<h2 id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION</h2>


<p><span class="upper">This</span> book does not pretend to be an exhaustive
treatise on the subject of horsewomanship. It is
offered merely as a collection of the most important
points gleaned in my career as a horse-lover and professional
horsewoman. While from experience alone
a rider may evolve good form if she is a natural born
horsewoman, yet this is so rare that, with most of
us, a knowledge at the start of the general fundamental
principles which are the basis of form in riding
and driving, is essential. It was my good fortune
to have my mother, Mrs. Emily S. Beach, lay the
foundation for me and, similarly, these chapters may
aid some of my readers.</p>

<p>Nothing in this book is hearsay. That which
takes but a moment to tell has taken me years to
learn; learned as a pupil; learned as a teacher;
learned by observation; learned by exhibition, by
many a triumph, by many a heart-break; much of
it a pleasure, much a hard task, but repaid always
by my comrades through it all&mdash;the horses.</p>
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii" title="viii"> </a><!--010.png-->

<p>I desire to express my thanks to Messrs. Brewster
&amp; Co., Mr. Herman Haas, Messrs. Martin &amp; Martin,
Messrs. Whippey, Steggall &amp; Co., The Durland Co.,
and Mr. P. Nardī for the many illustrations and suggestions
which they have kindly given me. Many
of the illustrations are from photographs which my
friends have been kind enough to send me.</p>

FORM IN RIDING</h3>


<p><span class="upper">With</span> all the changes in fashion and fads, riding
still holds its own, and the field which it
occupies can never be invaded. For women, quite
as much as and even more than for men, it is of all
exercises the one best adapted to keep them in condition,
to restore the glow of health, and to key up
the whole system to respond to all the delights of
life. No less for a woman than for a man is the
old saying true, “There is something about the
outside of a horse that is good for the inside of a
man.”</p>

<p>Self-made riders are apt to scoff at what is termed
“form,” but “form” is neither fad nor fashion. It
is that way of doing any particular thing that is
recognized as the best. This is why a self-taught
person is at a disadvantage. She may, possibly
from her experience, have worked out the correct
theory of riding, but she has not had the advantage
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_4" id="Page_4" title="4"> </a><!--020.png-->
of learning all that has been worked out by others,
and it is the assimilation of the results of others’
experience that constitutes form.</p>

<p>Riding should, I think, be as much a part of a
child’s education as any of the subjects taught at
school; in fact, I would paraphrase and say that
“Reading, Riding, and ’Rithmetic” were the essential
elements of every child’s education. All children
find in it the keenest pleasure, and to the delicate
child it offers salvation. Once the first difficulties
are overcome, the benefits are soon realized. Benefits
not only to the general health, with restored
circulation and appetite, but to the character which
acquires patience and self-control&mdash;qualities quite
as essential as the proper use of hands and legs for
the making of a horsewoman.</p>

<p>I do not, however, approve of very young children
taking riding lessons. The age of seven is quite
young enough, for when younger than that a child’s
legs are so short that it is difficult for her to keep her
balance at any gait faster than a walk. But I do
approve of very young children becoming accustomed
to the motion and acquiring balance by being held
on the back of a very quiet pony, which, of course,
should not go beyond a walk. The great danger in
beginning too young is that the child may have a
fall, and, if she does, may receive a shock to her
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_5" id="Page_5" title="5"> </a><!--021.png-->
nervous system, the effects of which will make her
timid about horses for years to come.</p>

<p>I like to have a child come to me for her lesson
without fear, not timid from any past experience,
yet enough awed at assuming control of so big an
object as a pony to have respect for, and be dependent
on, her teacher. Later on, confidence will
come with increasing knowledge, and so her education
as a horsewoman will be properly begun.</p>

<p>Although learning to ride in childhood is certainly
an advantage, yet age is not necessarily an impediment
to a woman’s learning the art. I have known
many women who have never been on a horse’s back
until they were forty years of age, or even older,
who, after a few courses of lessons, have derived
much pleasure from their riding, and, with application,
have even become proficient. However, the
best riders, like the best singers or pianists, are born,
not made, and there is a grace about the natural
rider that cannot be attained even by the most thorough
training.</p>

<p>Form in riding depends chiefly upon a correct
seat, and that in turn depends upon balance and correct
position. Balance can only be attained by keeping
the muscles relaxed and being ready to respond
at any moment to every movement of the horse. It
is impossible to acquire balance if all the muscles
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_6" id="Page_6" title="6"> </a><!--022.png-->
are stiff all the time. The body should sway in
rhythm with the horse’s gait. This not only looks
well, but saves both rider and horse from all unnecessary
exertion and fatigue.</p>

</div>

<p>Quite as important as balance is the proper
position in the saddle. The first point, remember,
is that the body must be squarely in the saddle,
neither to the right nor to the left, and the right
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_7" id="Page_7" title="7"> </a><!--023.png-->
thigh must be kept pointed almost directly to the
front. The body is kept in this position by having
both legs at all times in their correct position. The
right thigh should be well down on the saddle and
the right knee should both press down and pull back
on the upper pommel. The right leg from the knee
down should be kept close, but not <em>rigid</em>, against the
saddle-flap and should be nearly vertical, neither
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_8" id="Page_8" title="8"> </a><!--024.png-->
thrust forward nor sideways nor twisted back, <em>and
the right leg should not touch the left leg</em>. If the right
leg is kept in proper place, the right shoulder&mdash;the
bane of so many women riders&mdash;will be neither forward
nor down, but squarely in line.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="small-caps">Incorrect Position of Legs</span><br />

Left leg too far back</div>
</div>

<p>The left leg should be kept in the same position
as a man’s leg, that is, held in firmly against the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_9" id="Page_9" title="9"> </a><!--025.png-->
saddle. The left knee should be slightly bent and
the leaping horn and the stirrup-leather should be so
adjusted that the former will press down and over
the left thigh about five inches above the knee.
Side-saddles have two holes, in either of which the
leaping horn may be screwed, and for most women
it is more comfortable to have the horn in the lower
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_10" id="Page_10" title="10"> </a><!--026.png-->
hole. The left leg below the knee should be vertical,
neither thrust forward with the heel down nor
back with the toe below the level of the heel, nor, on
the other hand, thrust out at an angle of forty-five
degrees or so from the horse’s side. All but experienced
riders should ride with the ball of the foot
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_11" id="Page_11" title="11"> </a><!--027.png-->
resting lightly on the stirrup-iron, with the heel a
trifle down and the foot parallel to the horse, or, if
possible, pointed in, and this should be done by turning
the leg at the thigh joint, just as is later described
in the cross seat. When a rider has become
expert she may ride with her foot “home,” that is,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_12" id="Page_12" title="12"> </a><!--028.png-->
with the instep resting on the iron. It is always advisable
to ride with the foot “home” when the horse
shies or takes a fast gallop.</p>

HANDS</h3>


<p><span class="upper">The</span> hands should be held on a level about six
inches in front of the waist; the forearms horizontal,
the upper arms hanging naturally from the
shoulders, so as to keep the elbows level, and in a
vertical plane with the shoulders. Bowing the elbows
out, or, on the other hand, clapping them too
close to the sides, are common faults, and are equally
bad not only for the sake of appearances, but because,
in either of these positions, the strength of
the arms is lessened. Similarly, the elbows should
not be carried back when the hands are in position,
for, if they are, you cannot pull the horse up should
he stumble, or, on occasion, stop him suddenly; nor
should they be carried forward over the knee, for
that position is stiff and tiring and gives the body a
tendency to bend forward.</p>

<p>In jumping a horse trained to jump in the American
fashion, when approaching the jump, the hands
are carried well forward and, at the same time, the
body is also carried forward. The reason for this is
partly to help the horse over the jump, and partly
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_15" id="Page_15" title="15"> </a><!--031.png-->
because the horse, before he rises, throws his head
far to the front, and the rider’s hands and body move
with him. On landing, the horse’s head and with it
the rider’s body and hands resume their normal position.</p>

<p>Both hands should be kept in position, and neither
arm should ever be allowed to hang at the side in
military fashion. Nothing looks worse in park riding
for either a woman or a man. In riding a horse
that is bridlewise and perfectly broken so that he
will obey the slightest movement of the reins and
can make all the changes of action and of gait by a
mere suggestion from one hand, the other hand should
still be kept in almost the same position as if it held
the reins, and remember that if it is necessary to rearrange
the hair or the hat, or if you wish to make
any gesture with the right hand, to be sure to transfer
the whip to the left hand. By neglecting this
precaution and carrying the whip in the right hand,
when it is moved about, your horse, or your companion’s,
may see the whip and think he is about to
be struck, and a serious accident may result.</p>

<p>The left hand is the bridle-hand and the one in
which the reins should habitually be carried. After
mounting, and in first taking up the reins, remember
that the snaffle rein is a trifle longer and wider than
the curb rein and that the ends of the snaffle reins
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_16" id="Page_16" title="16"> </a><!--032.png-->
are joined with a buckle while the ends of the curb
are stitched together.</p>

<p>There are different ways of first taking up the
reins. One of the best is to grasp them together in
the right hand, the curb reins in the middle and the
snaffle reins on the outside, drawing them sufficiently
tight to feel the horse’s mouth very lightly, with the
ends passing through the hand and out under the
little finger; then, holding them all horizontal, to
pass the left hand down on them vertically, the near
snaffle rein outside the little finger, the near curb
between the little finger and the third finger, the
off curb between the second and third fingers, and
the off snaffle between the first and second fingers.
Then let go with the right hand and turn the left
hand into its position with the ends of the reins coming
out between the thumb and forefinger.</p>

<p>Another way is first to take up the snaffle reins
with the right hand, the off rein outside the little
finger, the near between the first and second fingers,
feel the horse’s mouth lightly, and then pass them
into their correct position in the left hand, the near
snaffle outside the little finger, the off snaffle between
the first and second fingers; then pick up the curb
reins with the right hand and pass them to the left
hand separated by the third finger.</p>

<p>A third way is first to pick them up in the right
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_17" id="Page_17" title="17"> </a><!--033.png-->
hand in the same position in which they should finally
be in the left hand, except that the off and near reins
are reversed; that is, the off snaffle rein comes outside
the little finger, and the near snaffle rein between the
first and second fingers, and similarly with the curb.
Then drop the left hand over them, in front of the
right, as above described, with the fingers in their
correct final position. This position has been already
described, but I will state it again: The near
snaffle rein comes outside of the little finger, the near
curb rein between the little and third fingers, the off
curb rein between the third and second fingers, the
off snaffle rein between the first and second fingers;
the ends of the reins come up through the hand and
fall to the right between the thumb and forefinger.</p>

<p>The reins should be adjusted to their proper
length with the right hand so as to feel the horse’s
mouth lightly before the fingers of the left hand are
closed on them. With regard to the ends of the
reins, it is equally correct to have all four reins one
upon the other, and then put the thumb on top of
them all, or to put the thumb on top of the snaffle
reins and have the curb reins pass to the right of the
thumb, if one is riding on the snaffle; or, if one is
riding on the curb, to have the thumb resting on the
curb reins and the snaffle reins passing to the right
of the thumb.</p>
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_18" id="Page_18" title="18"> </a><!--034.png-->

<p>The reins should be properly arranged in the left
hand, as I have described, at the start, when the
body and the elbow are in their correct positions, and
they should be held at this same length at all times
and not allowed to slip through the fingers. They
should be held by pressing the edges of the reins, with
the fingers, against the cushion of the hand, and not
by squeezing the flat surfaces of the reins between
the fingers. The principal reason why beginners let
the reins slip through their fingers is that they do
not hold the reins by the edges.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>The whip, crop, or stick, whichever may be carried,
belongs in the right hand, but the whip and
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_19" id="Page_19" title="19"> </a><!--035.png-->
stick are both carried with the handle up and the
small end pointing downward whereas the crop
should always be carried with the handle downward
and the loop end upward. The reason for this is,
probably, because in England crops which have handles
are used for opening the latches of gates, and,
when held in this position, the handle can be quickly
used for this purpose without the crop being shifted.
Another reason is because, when used in the hunting
field with the lash, the lash can be got out quickly,
and the crop will be in position for use at a moment’s
notice. Whichever of the three, whip, stick, or crop,
may be carried, hold it lightly in the palm between
the thumb and first finger of the right hand.</p>

<p>I have already described the position of the reins
in the left hand. The next thing to be considered is
the position of the left hand itself when holding the
reins.</p>

<p>As I have said, the forearm must be horizontal.
The hand must be held with the knuckles nearly vertical,
and not horizontal, as many hold it. The hand
must be bent in toward the body at the wrist, and
the wrist must be flexible so as to give slightly with
the movement of the horse’s head. Nearly all beginners
have great difficulty in remembering to keep
the wrist bent, as they are apt to straighten it out
so as to give a direct tug on the horse’s mouth with
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_20" id="Page_20" title="20"> </a><!--036.png-->
their arm, and so lose the spring which the supple
wrist would give them.</p>

<p>The right hand should be held symmetrically with
the left, bent in at the wrist in the same way, and
with the knuckles at about the same angle. For beginners,
it is better, until they have acquired fairly
good “hands,” to hold the bight of all four reins in
the right hand between the thumb and forefinger,
about an inch from the left hand and just below
the whip, the bight of all four reins passing through
the right hand and out under the little finger. This
keeps the right hand in position ready for an emergency,
but it does not allow it to interfere with the
even pressure and “feel” which the left hand has on
the horse’s mouth, with both the near and off reins.
Remember that, under normal circumstances, all four
reins must be held firmly in the left hand, and that
there must be an exactly even pressure on the horse’s
mouth on both sides, and that, in order to keep the
reins so and prevent them from slipping, they must
be held by the edges between the second joints of the
fingers and the cushion of the hand, and must also
be firmly pressed down between the thumb and forefinger.</p>

<p>The right hand should, as it were, be kept in reserve
and used as circumstances may require. For
instance, if the horse is thoroughly bridlewise, he will
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_21" id="Page_21" title="21"> </a><!--037.png-->
have been trained to turn to the left by passing the
left hand to the left, at the same time slightly turning
it on the upper arm as a pivot, thus touching the off
side of the horse’s neck with the off reins; similarly,
to turn to the right by carrying the left hand to the
right, and turning it to the right on the upper arm as
a pivot, thus bearing the near reins against the near
side of the horse’s neck. Many saddle-horses, however,
have not been trained to this, so they have to
be turned in riding very much as in driving; that is,
by pulling the rein of the side toward which they
are to turn.</p>

<p>Now, with a horse which has an exceptionally
sensitive mouth, and a rider with exceptionally good
hands, this can be done by a mere turn of the left
wrist; but if the horse has not a sensitive mouth, or
the rider has not very good hands, the right hand
must be called into assistance. In such a case turning
the horse to the right is very simply accomplished
by taking the off reins in the right hand a few inches
in front of the left (which, however, must retain its
grasp of all the reins without shifting), separated by
the little finger, the two reins passing out between
the thumb and forefinger. Then, by a slight pressure
of the right hand, bring the horse’s head around
to the right.</p>

<p>Turning to the left, however, is not done by taking
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_22" id="Page_22" title="22"> </a><!--038.png-->
up the near reins in the right hand, as in driving, but
by taking the off reins in the right hand just as if one
were going to turn to the right, but without any pull
on the off reins. Then letting the off reins slip slightly
through the fingers of the left hand, and pulling the
near reins with the left hand enough to make the horse
turn, and as soon as the turn is accomplished, restoring
the reins to the former position in the left hand.</p>

<p>Another purpose for which the right hand must
be always available is for shortening the reins. This
should be done by grasping the bight or ends of all
four reins together in the right hand, behind the left,
between the thumb and forefinger, passing through
the hand and out by the little finger, and slipping
the left hand up on the reins as much as may be
needed.</p>

<p>If, however, more strength is required than can
be had from the left arm only, the right hand should
be placed on all four reins in front of the left hand,
which, of course, will have to be turned so as to bring
the knuckles horizontal, the reins occupying the same
position in the right hand as in the left, only reversed;
that is, the off snaffle coming outside the little finger,
and the near snaffle between the first and second
fingers, etc. The fingers of the right hand are then
closed upon the reins and the horse pulled in with all
the strength of both arms.</p>
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_23" id="Page_23" title="23"> </a><!--039.png-->

<p>I do not mean to imply for a moment that any
horse can be pulled up or stopped by a steady pull
on the reins, for no woman is strong enough to stop
a horse who is determined to run, by pitting her
strength against his. There must be a “give and
take,” and even in stopping a runaway, alternately
giving him his head and then pulling him in, is far
more effective than a steady pull; nor should a horse
ever be stopped or pulled up with a jerk unless to
avoid running over a child or in some other emergency.
To stop a horse or make him slow down, he
should first be given his head slightly by carrying the
hand forward, and then pulled up gradually. If you
start to pull a horse with a violent jerk you will
immediately excite his resentment and make him pull
against you with all his strength, and you will end in
giving him a hard mouth and developing a “puller.”</p>

<p>Another purpose for which the right hand should be
in readiness is to tighten the curb reins. If the horse
is being ridden, as he usually will be, either with the
pressure on all four reins about even or with the curb
reins somewhat looser than the snaffle, and he starts
to pull, or there is some other occasion for using the
curb, the right hand may be brought over in front of
the left and the curb reins taken in the right from
two to six inches in front of the left hand, separated
by the third finger, passing out between the thumb
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_24" id="Page_24" title="24"> </a><!--040.png-->
and forefinger. The curb can then be tightened with
the right hand without affecting the snaffle, and the
horse made to slow down or stop, as may be required.
Great care, however, should be taken by beginners
not to attempt to do this, as they would be
almost certain to put far too great pressure on the
curb, might cause the horse to rear, and would be
very apt to make him start to run, through obstinacy.
I would, therefore, never advise a beginner to attempt
to take up the curb reins in this way unless
some emergency made it imperative.</p>

<p>Some riders with very light hands, when riding
very powerful horses with rather hard mouths, may
find it desirable to ride on the curb instead of on the
snaffle. In such case there are two positions which
may be taken. One is to put the curb reins in the
position of the snaffle reins and <i>vice versa</i>, and then
leave the snaffle reins somewhat looser than the curb.
This is a method much used with the Kentucky type
of saddle-horse and with horses which have been
broken to the use of the curb only, as are nearly all
army horses.</p>

<p>Another way of holding the reins when riding on
the curb is to separate the two curb reins with the
little finger of the left hand and the two snaffle reins
with the middle finger. The reins are then held in
the army fashion. Some horses have been broken to
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_25" id="Page_25" title="25"> </a><!--041.png-->
be ridden in this way, and the rider may find it easier
with them.</p>

<p>Neither of these last two ways of holding the
reins of which I have spoken should be attempted
by beginners as they will only confuse them.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>Another point which is very often neglected is
that the reins must not be twisted between the bridle
and their ends. Be sure that they are kept straight
at all times, as it looks very badly to see them twisted
either on the neck or in the bight of the reins, and
if the bight is twisted, one is very apt to mix the
reins when changing them.</p>
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_26" id="Page_26" title="26"> </a><!--042.png-->

<p>With regard to holding the reins in both hands,
this should only be done by beginners, and in the
hunting field, and with absolutely green horses who
have to have their heads pulled around in order to
turn them.</p>

<p>I shall discuss the position of the hands in the
hunting field in the chapter on hunting, and what I
have said about turning horses who are not bridlewise
covers all that needs to be said about green
horses.</p>

<p>Beginners should not use the curb reins at all,
and should hold one snaffle rein in each hand, the
snaffle reins being held in the position of the near
snaffle rein in the left hand, and the off snaffle rein
in the right hand; that is, passing outside of the little
finger up through the hand and held between the
thumb and forefinger. A beginner, particularly if
she has ever driven, will naturally start to take a
rein in each hand in the driving position, that is,
separated by the thumb and forefinger and coming
out under the little finger. This position is never
taken in riding. The object of taking a rein in each
hand is to accustom the fingers to the reins, and the
rider to holding the right hand parallel with the left.
Keeping the right hand in a corresponding position to
that of the left not only looks smart and neat, but it
helps to keep the right shoulder in place. Of course,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_27" id="Page_27" title="27"> </a><!--043.png-->
in the side-saddle, the tendency of all beginners is to
carry the right shoulder forward and higher than the
left. If the right forearm is held symmetrically with
the left forearm, the right shoulder cannot be out
of place.</p>

<div class="side-by-side" id="illus-027">
<div class="figcenter">

Reins in same position in each
hand</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In riding astride beginners should also hold a rein
in each hand, as holding the reins in the left hand
only tends to pull the left shoulder forward and out
of place. So when riding astride, the symmetrical
position of the right hand and arm with the left
brings the right shoulder forward and keeps the
shoulders square.</p>
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_28" id="Page_28" title="28"> </a><!--044.png-->

<p>I have mentioned above the reasons for sometimes
reversing the positions of the curb and snaffle.
Another case where this may properly be done is
where a running martingale is used.</p>

<p>Next to balance, light hands are the most important
attribute of a good rider. They really are a
gift, like an ear for music, or a delicate sense of touch,
or acute vision, and go with a certain nervous and
sensitive temperament. Some riders have naturally
light hands and scarcely need any instruction with
regard to them. With them the feeling of the horse’s
mouth is instinctive. Light hands, however, can, to a
great extent, be cultivated, and there is no excuse for
any experienced rider having heavy hands. Women
are more apt to have light hands than men, and
while men may rely on strength to control a horse,
and can control many horses by sheer brute force,
women very seldom have sufficient physical strength
to do this. Women should seek “the strength of
effect and not the effect of strength.”</p>

<p>It is hard to define the term “light hands.” If I
might attempt a definition, I would say that the
hands serve as a means of communication between
the horse’s and the rider’s mind, so that the rider,
through the touch of the horse’s mouth, communicated
through the reins and hands, knows what is
in the horse’s mind and so can make the horse’s mind
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_29" id="Page_29" title="29"> </a><!--045.png-->
instantly respond to the rider’s will, and thus the
rider and horse are at all times in sympathy, and the
horse acting with, and not against, his rider, and the
rider with, and not against, her horse.</p>

<p>Lightness does not in any way denote weakness,
for, behind the light touch, there must always be
firmness, decision, and strength. Nor does lightness
mean a touch so vague that it produces upon the
horse’s mind an impression of vacillation. In riding
it is most important for the rider, once she has made
up her mind what to make the horse do, to make
the horse do that thing and not allow him to do anything
else. One might, indeed, say that lightness of
hands is very closely akin to tact and that it is a
means of inducing a horse to adopt as his own the
will of his rider.</p>

<p>I spoke a moment ago of strength. By this I
mean firmness and not brute force. If a rider is
fortunate enough to be gifted with lightness, she will
be able to control her horse by a spirit of love instead
of adopting the brutal method of controlling
him by fear and having him prepared at every moment
to obtain his revenge upon his rider, as a horse
that has been treated brutally is almost certain to
do when he has the opportunity.</p>

<p>Coupled with the lightness of hands should be
fearlessness in the mind of the rider, and the horse
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_30" id="Page_30" title="30"> </a><!--046.png-->
must know both that the rider is fearless and that
she trusts him. If the rider shows a lack of confidence
in the horse and acts as if she were suspicious
of him, the horse will soon know it, and will do exactly
what the rider fears that he will. A horse has
a mind which very readily receives impressions from
the rider’s mind. For instance, a rider expects a
horse to shy at some object; she will unconsciously
impart that thought into the horse’s mind and the
horse is almost certain to shy; but if she will say to
herself, “there is nothing to shy at, we will simply go
quietly by this”; if she does not interfere with the
reins and gives the horse absolutely no sign that she
has any thought of shying in her mind, the horse will,
nine times out of ten, if not ten times, pass by the
object without showing the slightest alarm. It is
usually the rider that shies and not the horse. Some
riders make the great mistake of first thinking that
a horse is going to shy at some object, then forcing
him, by whip and spur, to go up to that object and
pass it. They will thus bring the horse to a state of
the most pitiable excitement and panic, and, while
they may succeed, they may be quite sure that the
next time he sees that object, or goes by the same
place, he will be far more afraid, for he will dread not
only the object itself, but a repetition of the whipping
and spurring.</p>

MOUNTING&mdash;SIDE-SADDLE</h3>


<p><span class="upper">There</span> are two ways of mounting with the side-saddle&mdash;from
the ground and from the block.
The former method is preferable, as a block is seldom
available, and a woman should always be able
to mount from the ground with or without assistance.
To mount from the ground without assistance, stand
at the horse’s near side, facing the saddle. Lengthen
the leather to the last hole, take up the reins in the
left hand and then place it on the upper pommel.
Place the left foot in the stirrup, assisting with the
right hand if necessary, then grasp the cantle with
the right hand and spring from the right foot, pulling
yourself up with both arms, and throw the body
into the saddle, letting go with the right hand just
as you reach the saddle. Then raise the right knee
and place it over the pommel, shorten the leather
to its proper length, adjust the skirt, and place
the loops over the feet. While this is easy for a tall
woman with a pony, it is very difficult for a short
woman with a large horse, so in that case the best
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_32" id="Page_32" title="32"> </a><!--048.png-->
thing to do is to stand your horse downhill or in a
ditch, or to stand yourself on a stone or a fence&mdash;if
one is available.</p>

Left foot in stirrup, right hand grasping cantle</div>
</div>

<p>To mount with assistance, the leather being left
at its proper length, stand opposite the cantle, facing
to the front, place your left foot in the man’s
right hand or in both his hands clasped, then at an
agreed signal spring from the right foot and have him
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_33" id="Page_33" title="33"> </a><!--049.png-->
throw you, but not too high, into the saddle, then
place the right knee over the pommel and the left
foot in the stirrup.</p>

Groom holding the reins in his left hand and assisting with right hand only</div>
</div>

<p>If your horse is nervous or does not stand well,
it is better for the man who is assisting you to hold
the horse’s reins in his left hand and lift you with his
right hand only, or you can take the reins in your
left hand and place it on the pommel and your right
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_34" title="34">&nbsp;</a><!--050.png-->
hand on the cantle, and then let the man lift you
with both hands.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="small-caps">Mounted</span></div>
</div>

<p>In mounting from the block, the groom stands by
the horse’s head and holds him; you then sit on the
saddle, place your right knee over the pommel and
your left foot in the stirrup. The groom should adjust
the straps, or you may adjust them yourself,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_35" id="Page_35" title="35"> </a><!--051.png-->
and you should then take the reins in the left hand.
Never, under any circumstances, when mounting
from the block, put your foot in the stirrup before
you are in the saddle, as, if the horse should start,
you would lose your balance and have a fall.</p>

<p>In dismounting, with or without assistance, the
first thing to do is to take the straps off and clear the

left foot from the stirrup, then throw the right leg
clear of the pommel; gather the reins in the right
hand and place it on the pommel, then spring lightly
to the ground. If any one is assisting you, you
should place your left hand on his shoulder. It is
most important to clear the stirrup first, as otherwise,
with your right knee clear of the pommel, you
might lose your balance and be dragged.</p>

RIDING ASTRIDE</h3>


<p><span class="upper">In</span> these days of “advanced” ideas the advisability
of women aping men in yet another way,
by riding astride, is the subject of general discussion.
Many “authorities” upon riding&mdash;“mere men,” it is
needless to say&mdash;speak with enthusiasm of the day
when all women will ride in this, for most of them,
ungainly and unbecoming fashion. Personally, I deplore
this tendency and believe that it is a mere
passing fad and that, except under peculiar conditions
which I shall mention, most women ride best
and look best in the side-saddle.</p>

<p>The average woman is not built for cross-saddle
riding; her legs from the knee up are too short; her
thighs too thick; her hips too big, and she is cushioned
too high to enable her to keep close down with
the required firmness on the saddle. The side-saddle
certainly insures a stronger seat, especially in all
cases of pitching forward, as, for instance, with a
stumbling horse or a kicking one, or on landing after
a jump. With safety skirts and safety stirrups the
danger from dragging is obviated and this, the only
serious danger in the use of the side-saddle, is more
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_38" id="Page_38" title="38"> </a><!--054.png-->
than offset in my judgment by the great danger of
a woman being thrown because of her insecure seat
in a man’s saddle. Many claim that the cross-saddle
is safer than the side-saddle in case of a rearing
horse falling over backward. I do not agree with
this, for, in the first place, many good men riders
have suffered shocking accidents in this way and,
when riding in the cross-saddle, unless the rider succeeds
in throwing himself clear from the horse, he is
almost sure to have one leg broken. On the other
hand, with a side-saddle, if the horse comes down on
his off side, there is no danger of a broken leg, and
when the horse starts to rear a woman can usually
make him fall on the off side by pulling his head to
that side with all her strength, so that on this point
the ease of clearing oneself from a cross-saddle is
more than offset by the ability to throw the horse
with safety and make him fall on the off side.</p>

<p>Up to the age of eleven or twelve it is a good plan
for a young girl to learn to ride astride and so acquire
balance and confidence, but if she is to use the side-saddle
eventually she should certainly begin to use
it at the age of twelve, and I would advise beginning
as early as eleven. If she begins on the cross-saddle
and acquires the knack at this early age, it will be
easier for her to take it up again on occasion later in
life, and, of course, the advantages which come from
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_39" id="Page_39" title="39"> </a><!--055.png-->
learning to ride without a saddle can best be acquired
astride, though they may be acquired with a pommel
and leaping horn on a surcingle.</p>

</div>

<p>In riding, women are very generally accompanied
by men, and there are few occasions when a woman
has it in her power to look better&mdash;or worse&mdash;than
when in the saddle. It is only those women who are
built like men and very young girls who look at all
well astride. A woman with merely a normally developed
figure looks both ridiculous and immodest in
<a name="Page_40" id="Page_40"> </a><!--056.png [full-page illo]-->
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_41" id="Page_41" title="41"> </a><!--057.png-->
this position, and in an English saddle thoroughly ill
at ease.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="illus-040">
<img src="images/illus-040.jpg" class="photograph" width="600" height="377" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="small-caps">Correct Position for Riding Astride</span></div>
</div>

<p>Much as I disapprove of most women using the
cross-saddle, yet, as this book is intended to be a
somewhat complete treatise on riding for women, and
as many women insist on using the cross-saddle, and
as in some parts of the West, and in roughing it,
riding must be astride if at all, I shall make a few
suggestions about the way in which a woman can
best attempt to do this, though it is something in
which she can rarely, if ever, attain perfection.</p>

<p>The saddle for cross riding generally used by
women in the East is the same as a man’s, although
some makers are offering a cross-saddle especially
adapted for women (see illustration, <a href="#illus-155">page 155</a>). These
saddles are built more on the lines of an army
saddle, having more dip and a straighter flap than
those for men.</p>

<p>Many men, and nearly all hunting men and polo
players, use plain flap saddles; that is, without rolls
and cut well forward so as to give plenty of room
for the knees (see illustration, <a href="#illus-155">page 155</a>). This type
of saddle enables the rider to have his knees well
up and forward and gives him a very firm seat for
jumping. Few women, however, are long enough in
the legs from the knee up to take this seat, so most
women will find a roll flap saddle more comfortable.</p>
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_42" id="Page_42" title="42"> </a><!--058.png-->

<p>In the West the Mexican type of saddle is generally
used. This saddle has a high pommel, or even
a high horn in front and a very high cantle serving
as a back rest, making what is practically a “dished
out” seat, far better suited to a woman’s conformation
than the English saddle. The Mexican type of saddle,
however, is not adapted to a horse with a square
trot, but only to the loping or fox trotting horses
of the West. The reason for this is that in posting
or rising to the trot, the knees should be quite well up
and forward, and the Mexican saddle is so built that
in it one cannot take this position.</p>

<p>There are two distinct types of seats recognized
in this country which may be called, for distinction,
the military and park seats; the former is the correct
seat for the saddle of the Mexican type. In this
seat the rider sits upright with the legs almost straight,
the knees scarcely bent, and the ball of the foot resting
on the iron, with the leather very long. In fact,
many military riders have their legs perfectly straight
and their toes down. This seat is comfortable only
on the “five-gaited” horses; that is, horses whose
gaits are the single foot, the lope, the canter, the
pace, but whose trot, instead of being the smart square
trot of the Eastern park hack, is more of a running
walk and is known as the “fox trot.” With a horse
that has a true, square trot, it will be found, as I have
<a name="Page_43" id="Page_43"> </a><!--059.png [full-page illo]-->
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_44" id="Page_44" title="44"> </a><!--060.png-->
said, that posting is both difficult and tiring with
this military seat and it is ill adapted for jumping
anything over two feet in height. In the
military seat the trot is taken up from the ankles,
so that the knees are slipping up and down,
while in the park seat posting or rising is done
from the knees, which should remain in the same
position at all times.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="illus-043">
<img src="images/illus-043.jpg" class="photograph" width="397" height="600" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="small-caps">The “Cowboy” Western Costume and Saddle</span></div>
</div>

<p>The park seat looks much smarter than the other,
and suits the gaits of the types of horses used in the
East far better and is the proper seat for the English
or hunting saddle. In this seat the stirrups are considerably
shorter and the knees are well bent and
carried in front of the leathers. The feet may be
carried “home” in the irons or resting on the ball of
the foot, as preferred. For hunting, the former is
the position used by almost all men and equally
advisable for women. Many of the best riders ride
with their feet “home” at all times because, with
most saddles, particularly if the rider has long legs,
with the feet “home” the lower leg is advanced about
six inches and, as it should be, carried vertically. This
brings the knee well in front of the leathers. This
position gives the correct hunting seat and that seat
is entirely correct for park riding. Personally, I prefer
riding with the feet “home” at all times.</p>

<p>To acquire a firm and balanced seat in riding
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_45" id="Page_45" title="45"> </a><!--061.png-->
astride, by far the best method for a child is to take
the first lessons on a blanket and surcingle without
stirrups, or on a felt pad with detachable wooden
stirrups. The seat must be close and the rider
should rely on balance and not on the grip of the
knees, except in jumping or in emergencies, such as
shying or bucking. The principle, whether with or
without a saddle, is to balance at all times, with an
intuition when to grip.</p>

<p>While women cannot be expected to go through
this preliminary course without saddle or stirrups,
it is unquestionably the best way to teach boys,
and I see no reason why girls should not go through
it as well. The great advantage of beginning without
stirrups is that it teaches a close seat at the
start. Many riders who have not learned by riding
at first without saddle and stirrups acquire the habit
of relying altogether too much on the stirrups to
keep their seats. In doing this their muscles are
kept rigid, they become stiff and awkward, and they
rely upon grip and strength, when they should rely
on ease and balance. This fault is especially common
with women, probably because they have been
used to the support of the pommel and leaping horn
of the side-saddle.</p>

<p>In riding bareback, or on a blanket, the rider, if
she is to retain her seat at all, must do so by acquiring
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_46" id="Page_46" title="46"> </a><!--062.png-->
a close seat, while in the saddle she can rely more
on the stirrups.</p>

</div>

<p>There are two recognized methods of mounting&mdash;the
“army” and the “English.” The latter is generally
adopted in the East, but there is much to be
said in favor of the former, even with the English
saddle, while it is far the better method with the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_47" id="Page_47" title="47"> </a><!--063.png-->
Mexican or army saddle. The English method is
this: The rider stands on the near side, facing the
saddle. The reins are gathered in the left hand in
their proper position, as described in the chapter on
“Seats and Hands,” and are drawn tight enough to
feel the horse’s mouth lightly. The pommel is then
grasped in the left hand. The left foot is placed in
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_48" id="Page_48" title="48"> </a><!--064.png-->
the iron, assisted by the right hand, if needed. The
cantle is then grasped in the right hand and the rider
springs from the right foot assisted by the pull of the
arms. The right leg is swung over the cantle and
into position on the off side of the saddle, while at
the same time the right hand is swung forward and
out of the way of the leg.</p>

Second position, body balanced by throwing weight on both arms</div>
</div>

<p>The army method is this: The rider stands at
the horse’s near shoulder, facing toward the pommel.
The snaffle reins only are gathered in the right hand
so as to feel the horse’s mouth lightly. The off rein
outside the little finger, the near rein between the
first and the second fingers, and the bight of the reins
passing between the thumb and the forefinger and
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_50" id="Page_50" title="50"> </a><!--066.png-->
falling on the near side of the horse so as not to be
caught in the right leg. The pommel is then grasped
with the right hand. The left foot is placed in the
iron assisted by the left hand, if needed. A lock of
the mane from six to twelve inches above the withers
is then grasped in the left hand and the rider springs
from the right foot assisted by the pull of both arms.
The right leg is swung over the cantle and into position
on the off side, the foot placed in the stirrup,
and then the snaffle reins are passed into the left
hand in their proper position and the curb reins are
taken up in the right hand and placed in their proper
position in the left.</p>

<p>This army method of mounting is claimed to be,
and I am inclined to think it is, safer than the other,
especially with a restive or kicking horse. It appears
to give the rider a firmer hold while in the act
of mounting. The rider’s weight is so far forward
that it is very difficult for the horse to rear, and the
rider, before placing his foot in the stirrup, stands so
far to the front that he is out of the reach of the
horse’s kick. When mounting in the English fashion,
if the horse rears before the rider has swung his leg
over, there is quite serious danger of an accident, and
a minor point is that, unless the saddle is tightly
girthed, it is very much less liable to slip when mounting
in the army fashion, as a large part of the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_51" id="Page_51" title="51"> </a><!--067.png-->
weight of the rider is supported by the horse’s
mane.</p>

<p>This army method of mounting is in general use
in the West, and of course in the American army,
and many men with army training habitually use it
with the English saddle.</p>

<p>In order to adjust the leathers to the proper length
before mounting, most women will find, as most men
do, that the stirrup from the tread of the iron to the
extremity of the leather should be the length of the
whole arm extended, and this may readily be measured
by placing the tips of the fingers on the stirrup
bar, so that the base of the iron rests against the
armpit.</p>

<p>After mounting, to adjust the length of the stirrups,
clear the feet from the irons and straighten the
legs so that they fall naturally. The tread of the iron
should then be made to come just at the ankle joint,
and the stirrups will then be the right length when
the feet are carried “home.”</p>

Right leg over pommel, left foot clear<br />

Few, however, can dismount in this fashion without shifting the reins</div>
</div>

<p>In dismounting, whichever method you adopt,
be sure to clear the left foot from the stirrup as well
as the right foot before you start. There are two
methods in vogue: the first is to clear both feet from
the stirrups and then throw the right leg over the
horse’s head, turning the body on the saddle to the
left and dropping the reins for a moment as the right
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_52" id="Page_52" title="52"> </a><!--068.png-->
leg goes over, and gathering them again in the right
hand as soon as it has cleared the horse’s neck; then
spring off the horse to the ground, steadying the body
with the right hand on the horse’s shoulder and
throwing the body well clear of the horse. This is
a very good way, unless your horse is nervous or apt
to rear. The other way is to throw both feet clear
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_53" id="Page_53" title="53"> </a><!--069.png-->
of the stirrups, then gather the reins in the right
hand and place it on the pommel. Place the left
hand on the horse’s neck and throw the body entirely
clear of the horse, the right leg passing over the
horse’s quarters.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="illus-053">

<div class="caption"><span class="small-caps">Dismounting</span><br />

Right leg over cantle, left foot clear<br />

This method is safer than the last</div>
</div>

<p>Many riders step off the horse; that is, they keep
the left foot in the stirrup, disengage the right foot,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_54" id="Page_54" title="54"> </a><!--070.png-->
throw the right leg around the horse’s quarters, then
step down in the reverse of the way in which they
mount. This, however, is rather dangerous, for, if
the horse should start when you are in the act of
dismounting, you are in a position where there is
almost no control and you are likely to have an accident
through being dragged with the left foot in the
stirrup.</p>

<p>It goes without saying that no reliance whatever
must be placed on the reins for keeping the
seat. Many beginners, and even some experienced
riders who should know better, whenever they feel
themselves losing their balance, hang on by their
reins. This invariably results in giving the horse a
hard mouth, and is very dangerous with a spirited
horse or one whose mouth has not been spoiled by
this practice, as it is almost sure to make him rear,
which causes the inexperienced rider to lose her seat
completely. It is the principal cause of the hard
mouth of the typical “riding-school horse.” No
rider with good hands will ever hang on by the reins,
and in nearly every case in my experience it has been
the pulling rider and not the pulling horse.</p>

<p>The secret of the close seat in the position astride
is to turn the legs inward <em>from the thigh joints so as
to open the legs to their utmost capacity</em>. This brings
the rider’s body in the closest possible contact with
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_55" id="Page_55" title="55"> </a><!--071.png-->
the horse’s back and brings the feet parallel, or nearly
so, to the horse’s body, and puts the knees and thighs
in the best position for gripping when necessary.
There is a great deal of knack about this. It is
not difficult to put one’s legs in this position at a
walk, but it is difficult to keep them so while the
horse is trotting or cantering, without having the
muscles rigid, whereas the leg should be kept in
this position with all the thigh muscles completely
relaxed, especially those underneath the seat. While
in gripping it is necessary to contract the muscles
on the upper inner sides of the thighs, these are
the only thigh muscles which should be contracted.
The contracting of the other thigh muscles tends to
throw the rider out of her seat. This seat can certainly
be acquired by practice and, once acquired, it
becomes second nature. The majority of riders and
nearly all women, instead of turning the legs inward
from the thigh joints, turn their knees out and grip
with the calves of their legs, with all their thigh
muscles rigid. Obviously, as the only joint in the
leg on which the leg can rotate is the thigh joint,
turning the knee out twists the whole leg the wrong
way. This results in the large muscles of the thigh
being contracted and in the rider sitting on them, instead
of sitting down close to the saddle. The difficulty
is that, with a beginner, it seems natural to
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_56" id="Page_56" title="56"> </a><!--072.png-->
turn the knees out and grip the horse with the calves,
but it is impossible to acquire a firm seat in this way,
and the position is not only awkward and insecure
but very tiring.</p>

<p>I cannot say too often that the seat must be acquired
by balance and all the muscles of the legs and
of the body and arms must be relaxed. If the leg
muscles are rigid and the legs are not turned inward
from the thigh joints, the rider will be lifted off the
saddle by the contraction of the muscles of the thigh
and will not be in balance. Dependence will then be
placed on gripping, and this gripping will be done
with the calves instead of the knees. A sure indication
that the legs are thus held is when the feet are
turned outward, for they cannot be unless the whole
leg from the thigh joints is so turned.</p>

<p>The legs should be kept well forward, with the
knees in front of the leathers, and the legs from the
knees down vertical and hanging naturally. At the
canter the legs from the knees down should be carried
forward rather than back. The body should be
well back in the saddle about two inches in front of
the cantle and resting comfortably.</p>

<p>Most beginners, although they may take this seat
while the horse is standing or at a walk, lose it the
moment he takes up a trot. They then begin to
lose their seats by leaning too far forward, contracting
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_57" id="Page_57" title="57"> </a><!--073.png-->
the leg muscles and bringing their legs back.
This is chiefly the result of fear, of self-consciousness,
and of “trying too hard.” It is one of the results
of the worst fault of nearly every beginner, that of
keeping the muscles rigid all the time and trying to
hold on by legs, pommel, reins, and mane instead
of merely sitting on in a comfortable position and
relying on balance.</p>

<p>With regard to playing polo, many women have
the idea that they can only play polo in a man’s saddle.
My opinion, based on my own experience and
the experience of many of my friends, is directly to
the contrary. Many women play polo, and play it
very well, in a side-saddle, and I do not know any
reason why a woman cannot play at least as well
riding in a side-saddle as riding astride. She certainly
has a more secure seat in the side-saddle, and
the first awkwardness of the back-hand stroke in
this position being overcome, all the other strokes are
quite as easy, and it is so much easier to ride another
player off when one is in the side-saddle that all the
women on both teams should ride either in the side-saddle
or in the man’s saddle in order to make the
game fair.</p>

HUNTING</h3>


<p><span class="upper">So</span> many books have been written on “Hunting”
and the subject so exhaustively treated, that I
shall only attempt to discuss under this head a few
points of particular interest to women.</p>

<p>When a woman hunts she enters a masculine field
of sport, and in the hunting-field she is meeting men
on their own ground and on even terms. In the
hunting-field, therefore, a woman must expect to
take her chances with the men, and she is not entitled
to that courtesy and deference which she may
expect on other occasions.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="illus-059">
<img src="images/illus-059.jpg" class="photograph" width="600" height="358" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="small-caps">Over Post and Rail</span></div>
</div>

<p>For example, if a woman loses her hat or stirrup,
she should not expect any man to pick it up for her
or to pay her the slightest attention. Again, if a
woman and a man are both going at the same fence,
she should not expect him to pull up and allow her
to go over first or to treat her otherwise than as he
would another man. It is not field etiquette. So,
if a woman has a tumble and is not disabled, she need
not expect the men to give up the hunt to help her
into the saddle. They are not supposed to do anything
<a name="Page_59" id="Page_59"> </a><!--075.png [full-page illo]-->
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_60" id="Page_60" title="60"> </a><!--076.png-->
of the kind. It follows, therefore, that if, for
example, a woman and a man are going at the same
panel and the man has the right of way, the woman
should yield to him and follow him over.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="illus-060">
<img src="images/illus-060.jpg" class="photograph" width="500" height="467" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="small-caps">A High Jumper and Hunter (Taconite)</span></div>
</div>

<p>The following are points of hunting etiquette
which must always be borne in mind; indeed, I may
almost say that they are rules which must be strictly
observed:</p>
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_61" id="Page_61" title="61"> </a><!--077.png-->

<p>Two riders should never go at the same panel
at the same time. While it is quite right for two or
more riders to go at the same fence at the same time,
it is not only against etiquette, but quite dangerous,
for two to go at the same panel. So in going
at a single panel&mdash;where, for example, there are trees
or wire on both sides, or for any other reason there
is only one panel in the fence which can be jumped,
or where it is what is termed in hunting a “trappy
place,” so that the field have to go over it one after
the other&mdash;if your horse refuses you should not put
him at it again, but turn him away from the panel
and then take your turn as soon as you have a chance
to swing in; otherwise you not only violate hunting
etiquette, but you are in great danger of causing an
accident to the rider who is immediately behind
you. Moreover, the whole field should not be held
up while your horse is trying it again.</p>

<p>At a check all the field should, if near the hounds,
stand still and keep quiet, for noise and motion disturb
the hounds when they are in the act of picking
up the scent.</p>

<p>The type of hunter suitable for a woman is described
in Chapter X&mdash;“The Saddle Horse.” No
woman should go into the hunting-field at all unless
she is a thoroughly experienced rider and has complete
confidence in herself. Even then she should
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_62" id="Page_62" title="62"> </a><!--078.png-->
not attempt to ride a green hunter until she has
had years of hunting experience. She should ride
a qualified hunter and, however experienced she
may be, she should bear in mind that, in all probability,
the horse knows how to take the jumps
better than she does. The maxim, “Let your
mount have his head while you keep your own,”
will carry a woman safely and surely to the finish.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="illus-062">

<div class="caption"><span class="small-caps">Giving Him His Head Over a Jump (Heatherbloom)</span></div>
</div>

<p>As a general rule, unless a woman knows her
mount thoroughly and has ridden him many times,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_63" id="Page_63" title="63"> </a><!--079.png-->
she should not attempt to help him over his jumps.
Every horse has an individual style of jumping, and
it is nearly always best to develop his own natural
style and not to attempt to make him jump in a way
that is unnatural to him.</p>

<p>There are three quite different ways in which
horses jump: one by rushing, one by taking the
jump in the stride, and the other by popping over.
One cannot say that any one of these styles is
best, for it all depends on the individual horse.
Some horses do best in one way, others in another;
and a horse who naturally rushes his jumps can
hardly ever be trained to pop over them quietly, and
the horse who has jumped in his own natural style
for years can jump far more safely in that style,
even if it be rushing, than if his rider attempts to
make him jump in any other style.</p>

<p>For a woman the best style of jumping is that of
the hunter who swings along and takes his jumps in
a steady stride, and who is neither too fast nor too
slow; who is up with the hounds, yet not on them.</p>

<p>What I am about to say with regard to the seat
and hands in jumping applies to hunting in this
country, not in England, for there the horses are
very differently trained; but in any case a woman
should always find out how a horse has been trained
before attempting to jump him.</p>

<div class="caption">Giving him his head over a jump</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>When in the field the best position in which to
hold the reins is to take them in both hands, the near
snaffle and the near curb in the left hand in their
usual position, and the off curb and off snaffle in the
right hand in their usual position, the snaffle and
curb in each hand being separated by the little finger.
The ends of the reins come through the right
hand between the thumb and forefinger and the ends
are gathered in a loop which passes between the second
and third fingers of each hand. While it is not
necessary to hold the reins in this position all the
time in the field, it is the best position to hold them
in when jumping. When the reins are held in this
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_65" id="Page_65" title="65"> </a><!--081.png-->
position the elbows should be in their usual place,
unless you are riding a horse who needs to be given
his head a little more, in which case they must be a
little to the front. Before coming to a jump the
arms should not be stiff and the hands should not
be held as far apart as the loop in the reins will
allow.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="small-caps">Side-Saddle, Position Rising, Hands and Body Forward</span></div>
</div>

<p>The position of the body and legs is the same as
I have described in chapter I, but, if anything,
the stirrups should be one or two holes shorter than
for ordinary riding, so as to have the left knee well
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_66" id="Page_66" title="66"> </a><!--082.png-->
bent and the leaping horn touching the left leg about
five inches above the knee.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="small-caps">Astride, Position of Legs, Hands, and Body at Top of Jump</span></div>
</div>

<p>When approaching a jump the horse should be
kept well in hand and should be gathered about two
strides before the take-off. The moment he takes
off he should be given his head by dropping the hands
and carrying them well forward with the elbows
nearly straight. This will carry the body well forward,
and both body and hands should be kept in this
position until the horse has cleared the jump, when
the body should be thrown back, so that, when the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_67" id="Page_67" title="67"> </a><!--083.png-->
horse lands, the rider’s body will be well back in
the position that it was before he took off.</p>

<p>In jumping, the reins should never be long and
must always be held at such length that if the horse
touches or stumbles he can be pulled up, and this can
only be done by carrying the hands well forward in
the way I have described. They must be carried forward
in order to give him his head, for, when a horse
comes to a jump, he throws his head very far forward
so as to get his balance and exert his greatest
strength.</p>

<p>What I have said above applies equally to a horse
that rushes his jumps, to one that takes them in his
stride, and to one that pops over. It is particularly
important to keep a rusher well in hand and not allow
him to get such speed before the take-off that he
cannot rise, for, in that case, he is almost sure to
crash into the fence and have a very bad fall. While
most horses need a good deal of speed to carry them
over the jumps, they should not be at their top speed,
for if they are they will not rise.</p>

<p>What I have said above applies to an American-trained
hunter.</p>

<p>If you are riding an English-trained hunter, the
manner of approaching a jump is entirely different.
With them, if you give them their head too much
they stop, so that in order to make them jump you
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_68" id="Page_68" title="68"> </a><!--084.png-->
have to lean back and pull on the reins. If you attempt
to jump an English-trained horse in the American
way or an American-trained horse in the English
way, you are very apt to come to grief.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="small-caps">Side-Saddle, Front View, Rising</span></div>
</div>

<p>What has been said above with regard to the
manner of jumping a fence applies equally to jumping
a ditch or anything else.</p>

<p>The higher or the broader a jump, the more important
it is to take it correctly. The difference
between the various jumps is well expressed in the
old maxim, “Fast at water and ditches and slow at
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_69" id="Page_69" title="69"> </a><!--085.png-->
timber”; but there is so much timber and so few
ditches and water jumps in this country, and the
pace is so fast, that this advice is hard to follow.
When I say fast I refer to drag hunting.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="small-caps">Coming Down</span></div>
</div>

<p>In hunting, a woman should be at either the front
or back. It is better for her not to be in with the
field, and she should regulate her pace according to
the horse she is on. If in a strange country, the best
thing for her to do is to follow some good rider who
knows the country well rather than attempt to pick
her way as she would in a country which she knew.</p>

</div>

<p>In hunting it is most important to save your
horse, to keep him fresh for the jumps, and not tire
him out at the start. Don’t ride to the “gallery,”
and if you have the choice between a sensational
jump and a gap, take the gap and save your hunter.
Remember that you are not giving an exhibition of
high jumping, nor are you in a horse-race.</p>

<p>Bear in mind that the master or huntsman sets
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_71" id="Page_71" title="71"> </a><!--087.png-->
the pace and that, ordinarily, particularly at the
start, he should be in the lead. One should not pass
the huntsman and, above all things, one should never
ride up on the hounds. If you come to a ploughed
field, go around it if you can, and, if you have to
cross it, spare your horse as much as possible.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="illus-071">

<div class="caption"><span class="small-caps">A Good Type of Hunter, Bred in the North (Ripple)</span></div>
</div>

<p>Somehow hunters go better for a woman than for
a man. Perhaps it is because a woman’s hands are
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_72" id="Page_72" title="72"> </a><!--088.png-->
lighter, either from ignorance or knowledge, or perhaps
it is because a woman is not so insistent and is
less domineering. It is always better to let the hunter
jump than to jump the hunter.</p>

<p>Ordinarily a good hunter may be hunted at least
twice in a week, but so much depends on the country,
on the rider herself&mdash;to say nothing of the
horse&mdash;that one cannot lay down any rule in regard
to this. Between the hunts, unless after an
unusually stiff run, a hunter may be larked a bit,
or driven to a light trap, or walked for an hour or
two. This will ordinarily keep him in better condition
than letting him stand in the stable. In fact,
in my own experience, I have known hunters that
were hunted one day and driven to market the next,
and the market I have in mind was not at all near
home. Many heavy-weight hunters are driven from
time to time in the wheel, and light-weight hunters
in the lead, both of a four and tandem. Indeed,
the leader of a tandem was originally a hunter. So
that a hunter may be a useful horse in the stable.</p>

<p>If one has a thoroughly reliable and seasoned
hunter well up to one’s weight, he ought to be able,
barring accidents, to carry one through the season,
unless one is attempting to hunt more than twice a
week, and there are few women in this country who
are strong enough to do that.</p>

are:</p>

<p>Breeches of either dog-skin or buckskin or white
cloth or of the same material as the habit.</p>

<p>The habit should be very dark gray, almost black,
hunting cloth. The collar should be of the colors
of one’s hunt.</p>

<p>The buttons should be black, with the name, design,
or monogram of the hunt in white or gold. The
correct coat is made without a seam in the middle
of the back and with two vents at the side instead of
one in the middle, and is somewhat shorter than the
habit coat that many women wear. It may be made
with five or three buttons, according to the wearer’s
fancy, but preferably with five.</p>

<p>An apron or half-apron skirt should be worn,
for safety’s sake.</p>

<p>The boots must be of black calf. Patent-leather
or russet boots are not correct in the field.</p>

<p>A silk hat is correct, but a derby or a hunting hat,
such as I have described in chapter VIII, may be worn,
and a hat guard, such as I have there described, is
necessary.</p>

<p>Either tan dog-skin or white buckskin gloves
are correct.</p>
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_75" id="Page_75" title="75"> </a><!--091.png-->

<p>An Ascot stock should be worn with a plain bar
gold pin.</p>

<p>Attached to the two D’s on the off-side of the
saddle should be a sandwich case with a flask in it,
a sandwich in the case, and a drink in the flask.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="illus-075">
<img src="images/illus-075.jpg" width="500" height="264" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="small-caps">Sandwich Cases and Flasks</span></div>
</div>

<p>A pair of white woollen gloves must be carried on
the off-side under the flap.</p>

<p>In England a crop is always carried in the field.
In this country it is correct, but a cutting whip may
be carried instead. If a crop is carried it may have
a thong, although, personally, I think it a great
nuisance.</p>

<p>The saddle and bridle are the same as I have
described in chapter IX, except that, in the field
side-saddle, a woman should always use a breastplate,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_76" id="Page_76" title="76"> </a><!--092.png-->
and if she has a horse that cannot carry a
breastplate she had better not hunt him.</p>

<p>As I state in chapter IX, a standing martingale
should never be used in the field, but a running martingale
may be used if the horse requires it, as is
often the case. For many horses the best bit to use
in the field is a plain snaffle, with very large rings,
so that the bit cannot be pulled through the horse’s
mouth. The bridle should have a cavesson, instead
of the usual noseband. Other horses go better with
what is known as a four-ring snaffle; that is, a snaffle
which, instead of having the cheek pieces attached
to the snaffle rings, has them attached to separate
rings, the rings to which the cheek pieces are attached
and the snaffle rings being of the same size
and both much larger than the rings of an ordinary
snaffle-bit. The reins only are attached to the
snaffle rings in this form of bit. This bit is more
severe than a plain snaffle, but much less severe
than a curb.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, only riders with very light
hands should use the curb bit in the hunting-field,
unless with horses having unusually hard mouths,
or “pullers.” In going over the jumps it is very
difficult to keep an even pressure on the curb, and
there is great danger of bringing up the horse too
short on landing.</p>

THE SHOW RING</h3>


<p><span class="upper">In</span> showing horses under saddle, the mental and
physical attributes of the rider have a greater
scope than when riding under any other circumstances.
Very frequently it is the rider who wins blue ribbons
quite as much as the horse, and at every horse show
one sees horses lose the ribbons which they should
win because of the crude way in which they are
shown. A woman, in justice to herself as well as to
her mount, should not enter the show ring until she
has become a thoroughly experienced and accomplished
rider, and however well a woman may ride
in the park or in the field, it by no means follows that
she will be able to bring out the best points of a horse
in the ring.</p>

<p>Just as there are horses which win countless blue
ribbons in shows, but do not compare with other
horses in the field or for general use, so, on the other
hand, there are women whose only delight is the
show ring. They hunt not, neither do they hack.</p>

<p>The experience which has been gained in ordinary
riding will not be of very great assistance in
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_78" id="Page_78" title="78"> </a><!--094.png-->
showing “horse show horses”; that is, horses which
are kept only for show purposes. These animals require
most careful handling and a thorough comprehension
of their individual characteristics.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="illus-078">
<img src="images/illus-078.jpg" class="photograph" width="500" height="468" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="small-caps">Lady’s Park Hack Type (Corinne)</span></div>
</div>

<p>The most important thing for a woman to bear in
mind when showing horses is to be a cheerful loser.
A feeling of good-fellowship should pervade and the
spirit of rivalry should not be carried to extremes.
Do not think that you have been unfairly treated
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_79" id="Page_79" title="79"> </a><!--095.png-->
when you have not won, or that the losing of the
blue necessarily means that your horse is not good.
Perhaps on this occasion he was not in his best form
and perhaps at some other time, before some other
judge, you will have better success.</p>

<p>One should always remember this: that the names
of the judges are published in advance, and if one
does not care to submit one’s horse to their judgment,
one need not compete. If, by any unfortunate
chance, the judges should be changed after one’s
horses are entered, there are two courses open&mdash;either
to stay in and abide by their decision or withdraw
one’s horses and state the reason. Certainly,
after having voluntarily submitted the horses to
their judgment, it is most unsportsmanlike and contrary
to the spirit of fair play to criticise the judges
for their decision, and it has been my experience,
after many years of showing horses, that the judges
are fair and impartial and do their best to render
their decisions upon the merits of the horses. One
should also remember that the judges are usually
men of very wide experience and thorough knowledge
of the points of a horse, and that they see many
faults and blemishes which would escape the eye of
the spectator.</p>

<p>A horse presents an altogether different appearance
when seen from within the ring to that which
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_80" id="Page_80" title="80"> </a><!--096.png-->
he presents from without. A horse that steps very
high and has a flashy, all-round way of going and
looks from without like a winner, may be seen
from within the ring to have serious faults, such
as dishing, paddling, crossing forward, or spreading
too wide behind. Outsiders, of course, do not
have the opportunity which the judges have to examine
the horses critically, and all they can base
their judgment on is the general effect which a horse
produces at a distance. A horse which may appear
to an outsider strong and bold may, on closer inspection,
be seen to be coarse-necked and heavy in
the shoulder or too big-boned for his class, and a
horse with truer action and better quality, conforming
to the standard of his class, may easily be overlooked
by the outsider.</p>

<p>To prepare a horse for the show ring requires
weeks and even months of work. He must be in
perfect condition; his coat must be fine, his eye bright,
and he must be neither too fat nor too lean, and his
preparation must be so timed that, on the day of
the show, he will be at the top of his condition.
All this involves good feed, plenty of water, and quiet,
systematic exercise.</p>

<p>It is most desirable that the person who is to
show the horse should have ridden him several times
before the show&mdash;the oftener the better&mdash;so that the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_81" id="Page_81" title="81"> </a><!--097.png-->
horse and rider may know each other thoroughly,
and the rider may understand all there is to be known
about that individual horse’s training, and how best
to bring out his good points.</p>

<p>I consider it a bad plan for a horse to come into
the ring too fresh. Some people seem to think that
horses must be saved up for the show. I think, on the
contrary, that horses should be worked quietly and
regularly for weeks before and during the show as
well. In the first place, the music, the noise of the
crowd, the strangeness of the scene, and of such a
gathering of people, all tend to excite a horse and
make him more difficult to control, so that this
excitement will give a horse all the appearance of
spirit that is needed. Besides this, a very fresh horse
rarely shows good manners, and in all ladies’ classes
manners count fifty per cent. By manners I mean
that on entering the show ring a horse must not look
as though he were about to make even a small, unharmful
buck; he must not be inclined to kick at
the horse back of him nor to bite the horse in front
of him; he must not stop at the gate as he passes it,
nor must he try to edge in toward the centre of the
ring while going around or when changing; he must
not hold his head either too high or too low; he must
not seem to be taking too much hold on the bit, nor
must it require three or four times around the ring to
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_82" id="Page_82" title="82"> </a><!--098.png-->
settle him down. In other words, he should not look
as if he were being exercised rather than shown.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="illus-082">
<img src="images/illus-082.jpg" class="photograph" width="500" height="437" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="small-caps">Lady’s Park Hack (Marksman) as he was when First Shown</span></div>
</div>

<p>In England they have a very good method of
showing horses in the ring; that is, they start them
at the canter, then bring them down to the trot, and
lastly down to the walk. In this way a horse is well
settled down, has lost most of his freshness and excitement,
and will usually walk quietly, as he should.</p>

<p>Here we start at the walk, then take the trot,
and then the canter. Consequently many horses
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_83" id="Page_83" title="83"> </a><!--099.png-->
under the influence of the excitement of the music
and noise will not walk or stop, but jigjog and side
step, which condemns a lady’s horse at once. Were
these same horses ridden in the English way, they
would be quiet by the time they came to the walk
and would win the blue ribbon which they deserve.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="illus-083">
<img src="images/illus-083.jpg" class="photograph" width="500" height="435" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="small-caps">Marksman a year later, after he had been “Fined Down,”
when he won the Championship</span></div>
</div>

<p>It is particularly desirable that this English
method of showing horses should be adopted, now
that the English type of riding horse&mdash;that is, a
thorough or three-quarter bred&mdash;is becoming so popular
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_84" id="Page_84" title="84"> </a><!--100.png-->
in this country. This is just the kind of horse
which will not start quietly at a walk in the show
ring. Probably our way of showing came into
vogue at a time when the ladies’ saddle horse was
a much quieter animal, with less of the hot thoroughbred
blood in him than he has now.</p>

<p>A horse should enter the ring at a quiet, easy
walk, not inclined, as I have said, to jigjog. He must
keep in line&mdash;that is, follow the horse in front of him&mdash;unless
his natural gait is faster, in which case you
have the right to pass and can swing into line when
you see a space.</p>

<p>He must take both the trot and the canter from
the walk at command. The latter is particularly
important in the ring, as it is not permitted to take
the canter from the trot. He must canter easily,
right or left, according to the way he is going around
the ring. That is to say, when going around to the
right he must canter on the right foot, and when
going around to the left on the left foot. Parenthetically
I may remark that the reason for this is that,
at the canter, a horse’s body is held diagonally to
the line of the direction in which he is going and
pointed in the opposite direction to the foot on which
he is cantering; that is to say, when he is cantering
right his body is pointed diagonally to the left and
vice versa. From this it follows that the foot on
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_85" id="Page_85" title="85"> </a><!--101.png-->
which he is cantering must be on the inside of the
circle or turn which he is making. Otherwise he is
almost sure to cross his legs and very apt to
fall.</p>

<p>It is very important, therefore, that a horse should
be able to change his foot at command. It is always
a strong point in a horse’s favor if he changes readily
from the right to the left in cantering, and while a
horse under the side-saddle should canter normally
right, he must canter left when circling or turning
to the left.</p>

<p>For the ring a horse must stand quietly, back
and start readily, and, when the horses are lined up,
he must be willing to leave the line and to show perfect
manners up and down the ring.</p>

<p>Fortunately for the exhibitors, the old-fashioned
way of putting horses through figure eights and
small circles has been done away with. Now, all
that is required in the ring is, first, walk your horse;
then, at the command of the ring master, change his
gait to a trot, and then, at command, walk again
and then pass from the walk to the canter and continue
cantering until the ring master tells you to
stop, and, of course, make such changes of direction
as he indicates.</p>

<p>Then the horses which are selected to stay in the
ring are lined up and the others are given the gate.
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_86" id="Page_86" title="86"> </a><!--102.png-->
Next, if the judges so desire, each of the horses lined
up is put through his paces. Then the judges, after
a detailed examination of each of the selected horses,
award the ribbons&mdash;blue for first, red second, yellow
third, and white fourth.</p>

<p>There are many important things to remember
while riding in the show ring. The most important
is to keep yourself and your horse under quiet
control. Then, no matter what the decision may
be, at least you have the satisfaction of having shown
your horse at his best. It is important to have a
place in line and try to keep it whatever it happens
to be. It is not at all necessary to pass the rider
ahead. Passing the rider ahead while in front of
the judge, at least, <em>looks</em> premeditated. It makes
it much harder for him to get a proper view of the
horse you are passing and does not help him to view
your horse, nor is it courteous to the other riders.
If your horse naturally walks, trots, or canters a
bit faster than the horse in front of you, so that,
to show your horse to his best, it is necessary to
pass, it is quite as easy to find an opportunity to
pass somewhere else than just in front of the judge.
So, when the ring master asks all the riders to line
up, it is not necessary that they should all attempt
to do so next to the judges’ stand. The judges do
not remain there, and the fact that your horse is
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_87" id="Page_87" title="87"> </a><!--103.png-->
nearer the stand does not bring him nearer the blue
ribbon.</p>

<p>In backing a horse, remember that his head must
not be too low on his chest. His neck should be well
arched up and his head drawn in on the neck and
high on the chest.</p>

<p>If you find that your horse does not back readily,
it is probably because his forefeet are too far forward.
In this attitude he is in the best position to resist you
whatever you may do, and you may find it impossible
to back him in the usual way. In such a case,
first give him his head and a touch with the heel,
starting him forward a step or two; then gather him
and, by pulling gently, you will find that he backs
readily.</p>

<p>In the ring always remember to do implicitly
what the judge asks. Even if the judge should demand
a circle, circle you must, and if a figure eight,
that too must be done.</p>

<p>After you have lined up and when your horse is
being put through his paces, remember, in turning,
always to turn your horse’s head toward the fence
and not toward the centre. If you turn toward the
centre, the horse is very apt to try to join the other
horses as they stand lined up, however good may
be his manners.</p>

<p>Of course, before you ride a horse in the ring, you
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_88" id="Page_88" title="88"> </a><!--104.png-->
must be sure on what signal he is trained to take the
canter. I have explained on <a href="#Page_84">page 84</a> that some
horses are trained to take the canter when the rider
turns their head to the side on which they are to
canter and touches lightly the curb rein on that side.
Other horses are trained to take the canter on merely
touching the curb rein on the side on which they are
to canter. Thus they are trained to canter right by
touching the right curb. Other horses, again, are
trained to take the canter on a signal given by raising
the curb rein on the side on which they are to canter
and at the same time carrying the hand to the other
side. Thus, to make such a horse canter to the right,
carry the left hand to the left and at the same time
raise the off curb rein with the right hand. It is,
therefore, most important to know the signal to
which your horse is accustomed; otherwise he may
either not take the canter or canter on the wrong
foot.</p>

<p>A most important point which should never be
overlooked is to be sure that your own saddle, which
you should use, if possible, in the show ring, fits the
horse you are to ride. Otherwise the horse may appear
to have lost his manners when the real trouble
is that the saddle is hurting him and making him
fretful and nervous.</p>

</div>

<p>In walking, while a horse should appear to have
<a name="Page_89" id="Page_89"> </a><!--105.png [full-page illo]-->
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_90" id="Page_90" title="90"> </a><!--106.png-->
his head, one must be careful not to let his head nod,
for this often gives an appearance of lameness. I
believe it is sometimes called bridle lameness. I once
had such an experience myself. The horse was perfectly
sound but thought to be lame because I had
given him his head too much; that is, ridden him
with too loose a rein. A horse, while walking, should
have his head well placed, not too low or too high,
and a horse whose head is up and neck well arched
is much more becoming to a woman than a horse
that carries his head down.</p>

<p>In general, in the ring, a horse had better be ridden
on whatever rein he has been trained to go by,
whether it be curb or snaffle, and so much depends
on the individual peculiarities of the horse and rider
that no definite rule can be laid down. The important
thing is to have light hands and not to do anything
to excite or annoy the horse.</p>

<p>Just a few more words of advice gleaned from
the experience of many years. Never, if you can prevent
it, display the slightest particle of nervousness
when mounting or on entering the ring. Horses&mdash;especially
the high-spirited ones&mdash;are very sensitive
to touch and to the mental attitude of the rider, and
they know at once from the rider’s hands whether
her head is steady and cool or nervous and excited.</p>

HINTS ON RIDING</h3>


<p><span class="upper">If</span> you have occasion to ride for any considerable
distance, and particularly if the weather is hot,
bear in mind that the weight of the rider and saddle
on his back for a long period of time tires the horse
quite as much as forcing him beyond his gait. It is
better, therefore, to keep a horse at a sharp walk or,
if you are trotting, at a sharp trot, so as to cover the
ground and then to rest him at intervals for ten or
fifteen minutes, than it is to keep going for the whole
time at a slow walk or trot. When you rest your
horse be sure to loosen the girths, and, if you have
far to go, it is better to take the saddle off entirely
and let the horse roll if he wants to, as few things
refresh him as much.</p>

<p>It is equally important not to force a horse under
saddle beyond his gait; find out his natural fast gait
and keep him at it and neither force him beyond it
nor let him lag.</p>

<p>If you have a nervous or high-spirited horse who
wants to go, it is far better to let him go in moderation
than to be constantly holding him back, as that
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_92" id="Page_92" title="92"> </a><!--108.png-->
worries and fatigues him and, in the meantime, you
are not covering the distance. So, if you are riding
in company and your horse is the more spirited of
the two, you will find it easier for your horse to let
him keep about one-half a head in advance of the
other, for, if you keep him level or hold him back, he
will be fretting all the time and tire both himself and
his rider.</p>

<p>In riding, even for a short distance, it is most
advisable to start and finish your ride at a walk, following
the old maxim, “Walk the first mile out and
the last mile in.” At the beginning of a ride a horse
needs to get going a bit in order to be limbered up
and catch his wind. So, if you start off, as many do,
at a fast trot or a canter, the horse will soon be winded
and the rest of your ride will be spoiled. If you
start him slowly, he will warm up to his work and you
will have the best part of the ride where it should
be&mdash;toward the end and not at the beginning. When
you bring your horse home he should be well cooled
off before he arrives, that he may not take a chill.
By bringing your horse home in this condition, you
save your groom a vast amount of work, and work
which only the most conscientious grooms can be
depended upon to do; that is, to cool the horse off
properly before he is stabled or fed.</p>

<p>With regard to the gait at which you should ride,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_93" id="Page_93" title="93"> </a><!--109.png-->
it is, of course, impossible to lay down any rule, so
much depends upon the rider, the horse, the length
of the ride, the season of year, etc., but one point
should be constantly kept in mind, and that is, unless
you are riding a trained hunter, to go down all hills
that amount to anything at a walk. If you have to
go down faster than a walk, a horse is much less
likely to stumble going downhill at the canter than
at the trot. It is also easier both for the rider and
horse to go uphill at the canter than at the trot;
though, of course, if the hill is a long one, it is better
to walk it. In going uphill, always give a horse his
head, and, in going downhill, keep him well in hand
and ride him on the snaffle so that you may be able
to pick him up the moment he stumbles.</p>

<p>In riding at night, when it is too dark for you to
see the road, let your horse pick his own way, as a
horse sees very much better in the dark than a
person.</p>

<p>If you are riding through a strange country and
lose your way, give him his head and he will find
the way home. Horses have an exceptionally well
developed sense of locality and can nearly always be
trusted to find their way home by instinct.</p>

<p>In these days of automobiles, it is important to
follow the rule of the road and always keep to the
right.</p>
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_94" id="Page_94" title="94"> </a><!--110.png-->

<p>If you have occasion to dismount and lead your
horse, by far the best way to hold him is, standing
on the near side, to take the two curb reins in the
right hand, separated by the forefinger and passing
through the body of the hand where they are firmly
held, keeping the hand about two or three inches
from the bit. In this position you have the horse
under perfect control, and, when you are leading him
with your hand in this position, do not look at him
or pay any attention to him and you will find that
he will follow. Whereas, if, as many do, you take
only one rein in hand along the horse’s neck and then
speak to him, he will either pull back or he may get
away from you and you cannot stop him. Approach
your horse’s head from the side and not the front,
and be sure not to raise your hand or whip or do anything
which might frighten him or give him the idea
that you were about to hit him on the head. Horses,
especially Western-bred horses, are very sensitive
about their heads and, if an attempt is made to grab
the reins suddenly or violently, they are almost sure
to back away and very apt to rear.</p>

<p>If your horse limps and you are alone, or the person
whom you are with does not know what to do,
you should immediately dismount and look at the
foot on which he is limping, to see if he has picked
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_95" id="Page_95" title="95"> </a><!--111.png-->
up a stone or run a nail into his foot. In picking up
a horse’s foot it is most important to put yourself
in a position where he cannot kick you. To do this,
approach the foot which is to be taken up from the
front, face to the rear, and grasp the horse’s fetlock
with the hand nearest to him. If he refuses to lift
his foot, push his foot forward and, if necessary, put
your weight against his shoulder or stifle, so as to
throw his weight on the other leg. If you have not a
hoof-pick about you, the best way to dislodge a stone
is to hammer it with another stone and, if you are
quiet and gentle with your horse, you probably will
be able to dislodge it without much trouble. If, however,
you cannot dislodge it, do not attempt to ride
your horse while he has the stone in his foot, but lead
him until you get assistance. If your horse has run a
nail in his foot, you must immediately have it drawn
out by some one who knows his business, as it is not
only very painful, but there is great danger of lockjaw.</p>

<p>In regard to park hacks and long-tailed saddle
horses, the only way to solve the problem in this
country of the two types, in horse shows, is to divide
the classes having long tails and short tails. At
present in horse shows in the saddle classes long-tailed
and docked horses are frequently entered in the same
class, which makes it doubly difficult for the judge,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_96" id="Page_96" title="96"> </a><!--112.png-->
at times causing his decision to depend largely upon
his personal preference for long-tailed or docked
horses. I would suggest, therefore, that in all shows
where the long-tailed and docked horses are not
divided into separate classes in advance, there should
be an informal division made before the judging,
very much as is done with respect to the championship
classes, where the judges often are permitted to
divide the classes into horses above and below 15.2.</p>

<p>Every horsewoman should have at least a general
knowledge of when and with what to feed her horse.
In general a horse should be fed three times a day,
and the allowance for the average horse is four quarts
of oats, at six in the morning, and as much hay as he
will eat about an hour later. At noon two quarts
of oats and hay about an hour later, and at night a
bran mash composed of about two quarts of oats and
an equal mash of bran, well salted. A horse should
never be watered after eating. He should be watered
about twenty minutes before his first morning meal
and may be watered about twenty minutes before
each of his other meals. There is no objection to
watering him at other times, not after feeding, and
in hot weather it is advisable to water him frequently.
When watering a horse in the stable, he should be
allowed to have as much as he wants to drink, but
the water should never be very cold. In winter the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_97" id="Page_97" title="97"> </a><!--113.png-->
chill should always be taken off the water before it
is given to the horse.</p>

<p>The above hours for feeding, except the hour for
his breakfast, must, however, be modified by the time
when he comes in from work, as a horse should always
have a good rest and be thoroughly cooled off before
he is fed oats. He can eat hay when he is hot but
never oats.</p>

<p>Many horses will require more than the above
allowance and many others less, and some horses
require as much humoring about their food as a
nervous child.</p>

<p>If a horse is very thin and not working hard, one
of the best ways to fatten him is to give him light,
steady work and mix molasses with his feed. If,
however, a horse is becoming poor in spite of taking
all his food, it is probably because his teeth are too
long and need filing down, as a horse with long teeth
will never masticate or digest his food properly.</p>

<p>With most horses, any food remaining in the
manger after a meal should be taken out and thrown
away, as the sight of it is apt to disgust them and
put them off their feed.</p>

<p>A sweating horse should not be watered unless
while on the road, in which case it does him no harm
to give him, from time to time, a drink of not too
cold water, but after each drink he should be walked
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_98" id="Page_98" title="98"> </a><!--114.png-->
for five or ten minutes before taking up the trot or
canter.</p>

<p>While on the road it is much safer not to let your
horse eat any grass, and if he does eat any, be sure
not to trot him until he has had ample time to digest
it. On the other hand, when a horse is brought home
and is being cooled off by the groom, it refreshes
him very much to be allowed to nibble the grass.</p>

<p>It is very advisable, if you have land enough, to
have a portion fenced off as a paddock, even if you
keep only one or two horses. When a horse comes
in tired, after a hard day, nothing refreshes him so
much as to be turned out without even a bridle, and
allowed to roll as much as he wants; and if horses
are not being used it is better for them to be turned
out for a few hours in the paddock rather than to
remain all day in the stall. If you have a paddock,
however, be sure that the fence is high enough to
prevent your horses jumping it, and be particularly
careful that the inside of the fence is smooth and that
there are no nails or barbed wire or anything that
might injure the horse. There are portable paddock
fences to be had, which are easily put up and moved,
and they are very useful when you move your stable
about from place to place.</p>

<p>If you are fortunate enough to buy a thoroughly
trained horse, the difficult thing is to keep him so
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_99" id="Page_99" title="99"> </a><!--115.png-->
without spoiling him by over indulgence on the one
hand, or, on the other, by arousing his obstinacy by
fighting instead of controlling him. Quite as much
tact and forbearance are needed in the handling of
horses as in handling children. They should not be
punished for trifling faults, nor should grave faults be
allowed to become habits.</p>

<p>Much can be done by caresses and the use of
the voice. But in the caressing be sure that the
horse does not think that you are slapping him.
Most horses resent being slapped on the back quite
as much as most of your friends. In fact, all horses
worth riding dislike anything that will startle them,
or any sudden shock.</p>

<p>It is easy to establish a sort of a private signal
code with your horse, which he will always understand.
It is only necessary always to do the same
thing to bring about the same result. If you wish
your horse to move the part of the body in front of
the saddle, the signal should be by stroking him on
the neck or shoulders, and if he is to move any
part of his body behind the saddle, he should be
stroked or touched on the quarters. If he obeys,
continue stroking, but if he disobeys or misunderstands,
cease the caress. In time he will come to
regard the caress as a signal. For example, if you
wish your horse to back, do not stroke him on the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_100" id="Page_100" title="100"> </a><!--116.png-->
neck, nor if you wish him to turn from one side to the
other should you stroke his quarters. Much more
can be done with a horse through kindness than
through fear. Unbounded patience is needed, and
the individual peculiarities of each horse must be
made the subject of careful study. Some horses are
intelligent while others are stupid, and it is with the
latter that good horsewomanship comes to the fore.
A stupid horse has to be led on step by step, and
should only be taught one lesson at a time and should
master that before proceeding with the next. When
you are training your horse and he shows obstinacy,
or appears to be stupid, before starting to punish
him or compelling him to obey your will, be sure first
that the cause of his obstinacy is not some petty
discomfort&mdash;such as an ill-fitting bit or a sore back,
too tight a girth, or indigestion. Nine times out of
ten the reason for a horse’s obstinacy is that he is
uncomfortable or that his mind is distracted by some
petty annoyance. Furthermore, a horse when he is
fresh can seldom be taught anything. The best
thing to do is to give him thirty or forty minutes
good straightaway work until he is calmed down,
and then you can command his attention. He will
then go along without gazing around or being distracted
by every passing trifle, and all his faculties
will be at the command of his rider.</p>
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_101" id="Page_101" title="101"> </a><!--117.png-->

<p>When riding in company remember there is a
“riding courtesy.” You have your comrade and your
comrade’s horse to consider as well as yourself and
your own horse. The two horses should be kept
going together, and on the same gait as much as
possible, so if your horse begins to urge ahead, keep
him back a trifle. There is nothing more annoying
than the “galloping friend” who will not take
the trouble to control her mount, and so makes the
other horse nervous and unmanageable.</p>

<p>Never “cluck” to your horse, even when you are
riding alone. It is a very bad habit to acquire, and,
when you are riding in company, the other horse
or horses are sure to hear you and to increase their
gait quite as much as you want your horse to increase
his. You are supposed to ride a trained horse, who
will obey the signals from the reins, heel, or whip,
and if your horse does not know these signals he
must be taught them before you ride in company.
Do not, however, under any circumstances, flourish
your whip or use it with such force that another
horse can hear it, for the effect will be quite as bad
as clucking.</p>

<p>If your horse lays his ears back and bites at the
other horse, do not pull his head away, especially if
you are up with the other horse, for that will put him
in a position where he can kick to great advantage.
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_102" id="Page_102" title="102"> </a><!--118.png-->
Instead of pulling his head away, rein him back and
keep his head straight.</p>

<p>If you have occasion to raise your right hand to
adjust your hat or hair, be sure first to place the
whip in the left hand, as otherwise your horse or
your comrade’s horse is very apt to be frightened
by seeing the whip flourished in the air.</p>

<p>A most important point to be remembered is that
your horse should be girthed before you mount him,
and never after mounting&mdash;first, because it is very
dangerous to mount with the girths loose, for if the
horse should break away from the groom, or whoever
is holding him, or even swerve or buck suddenly,
the saddle is almost sure to twist and there may be a
very bad accident; and, secondly, because girthing a
horse after the rider is mounted generally results in
the girths being drawn too tight, and too tight girths
not only cause the horse great pain but make him apt
to stumble or lag in his gait and become unduly exhausted.
Tight girthing has very much the same
effect on the horse as tight lacing has on the
rider.</p>

<p>If you have occasion to look to the rear, always
turn your body toward the right; not only is it much
easier to look around in this way, but you cannot
turn to the left without raising your right knee more
or less, and you are apt to raise it so high that if the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_103" id="Page_103" title="103"> </a><!--119.png-->
horse should start suddenly you would lose your
hold of the pommel.</p>

<div class="side-by-side" id="illus-103">
<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illus-103-a.jpg" width="262" height="300" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="small-caps">Safety Stirrup, Open</span></div>
</div>

<div class="figcenter">

<div class="caption"><span class="small-caps">Safety Stirrup, Closed</span></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>With the side-saddle, safety skirts and stirrups
should always be used, as with them a fall is very
unlikely to injure the rider. With the plain skirt
a bad accident may be caused through the skirt
catching on the pommels, and with a plain stirrup
there is great danger of being dragged by the
foot.</p>

<p>If the horse shies to the right, always remember
to throw the weight to the left; this keeps the legs
tight in position which enables the rider to maintain
her balance; whereas, if you throw your weight to the
right, you lose the grip from the right knee and have
no means of recovering your balance, so that a fall
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_104" id="Page_104" title="104"> </a><!--120.png-->
is inevitable. Of course, if the horse shies to the
left you should throw your weight to the left for the
same reason. Owing to the very strong grip of the
right knee over the pommel, it is almost impossible
for a woman to be thrown to the near or left side of
the horse; the only real danger is of being thrown to
the right, and, as there is nothing to stop a woman
from falling on the off or right side of the saddle, as
there is on the left, it follows that, toward whichever
side the horse may shy, the only thing to do is, as I
have said, to throw the weight to the left.</p>

<p>When you feel yourself being thrown, especially
if you have on a plain skirt or have a plain stirrup,
or both, be sure not to let go of the reins, for in case
you do not fall clear of the saddle, your one chance
for self-preservation is that in some measure you still
have control of the horse. If you keep hold of the
reins you have a good chance of being able to pull
him in and keep him from running away, and you
will save yourself from being dragged and probably
escape a very serious accident.</p>

<p>If a horse in the act of shying or balking succeeds
in turning half-way round with you, do not try to
turn him back against the direction in which he
has shied, but, instead, pull him quickly and completely
around in the direction which he has taken.
He will not attempt to resist you and you will at
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_105" id="Page_105" title="105"> </a><!--121.png-->
once have him back in his original position and
going in the original direction.</p>

<p>If your horse rears, give him his head immediately
and throw your weight as far forward as possible.
This will usually bring him down. If, however, you
feel that he is going over, remember that a horse
when he rears always falls to one side or the other.
Therefore, as soon as you find that he is bound to
fall, pull his head with all your strength to the right
so as to make him lose his balance and fall on that
side. The chances are that you will not be hurt,
whereas, if he falls to the left, you are almost sure to
have your legs caught beneath him and so be seriously
injured.</p>

<p>If your horse backs, give him his head and particularly
be sure not to have any pressure on the
curb, as that keeps his head in. Sit close and urge
him forward with the left leg and touch him on his
off quarter with your whip. If you are wearing a
spur, touch him lightly at first and then as hard as
may be necessary.</p>

<p>If your horse kicks or bucks, keep his head up
by loosening the curb and using the snaffle only. Sit
close and put him in motion, but be careful not to
let the left leg go back, as this is apt to terrify him
and make him kick or buck all the harder. Very
few horses will either kick or buck when they are in
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_106" id="Page_106" title="106"> </a><!--122.png-->
motion, and, unless the horse is vicious and is an
habitual kicker or bucker, his kicking or bucking
is usually caused by freshness, and the best thing to
do is to make him canter until he has calmed down.</p>

<p>If your horse balks, by far the best thing to do is
to distract his attention or else let him stand quietly
without offering him any resistance. A horse has
only one idea in his mind at a time, but that idea is
very fixed, so that if you strike a balking horse or
resist him, you will simply arouse all his obstinacy
and he will balk all the worse. The best way to
distract his attention is to pet him and speak to him.
In the course of a short time he will tire of the balking
and attempt to start forward. If at this moment
you keep him standing a bit longer he will become
possessed of the idea that he wants to go, and you
will have no more difficulty with him for the time
being. Indeed, I have found that this is by far the
best way to break a horse of the habit of balking.</p>

<p>When you are riding in company, an important
thing for both your companion and yourself to remember
is that if your companion, whether man or
woman, is mounted on a slower horse than yours,
and your horse starts to run, the very worst thing
that he can do is to try to catch you. The noise and
excitement which his horse produces will make your
horse run all the faster; his horse being slower, he
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_107" id="Page_107" title="107"> </a><!--123.png-->
will not be able to catch you, and you will be almost
sure to have a runaway. I have known of many
very serious accidents being caused through a man
trying to catch a girl’s horse when her horse was
merely galloping a little too fast. Unless your companion
is a thoroughly experienced rider and has a
horse that he knows is faster than yours, he had
much better rein his horse in and give you a chance
to control your own horse. It may also be remarked
that it is a very difficult thing to catch a runaway
horse, and any one who attempts it is taking a great
risk, not so much for himself as for the girl whose
horse he is attempting to catch, while another woman,
if mounted on a side-saddle, would have the greatest
difficulty in bringing herself into position to catch your
horse at all. If a woman using the side-saddle has
occasion to catch another’s horse, she should be sure
to keep the other horse on her near or left side. If
the runaway horse is on her right side, it is very
difficult for her to catch him without losing her
balance. If you do have occasion to stop a runaway
horse, you should, if possible, have your horse at
least a neck ahead of him, so that you may be sure
to catch his reins close by the bit when you grab for
them. If you attempt to catch the reins back of his
neck, it is very unlikely that you will be able to stop
him, and you are much more apt to cause a fall.</p>

CORRECT DRESS FOR THE SADDLE</h3>


<p><span class="upper">To</span> look well in the saddle a woman must be
correctly and smartly turned out. The picturesqueness
of the old-fashioned skirt, the plumed hat,
and the ambling palfrey has passed away, and a
woman’s riding clothes of to-day are designed, first,
for comfort, and second, for neatness. Absolute
plainness and everything in keeping are the principles
to be followed.</p>

<p>For the side-saddle the habit must be well cut,
well made, and of good material. The length and
style of the coat should be adapted to the wearer’s
height and figure.</p>

<p>The skirt should always be of the “safety” type.
There are several different designs of safety skirts,
but they may be divided into three classes&mdash;the
apron skirt, the half apron, and the skirt with patent
fasteners.</p>

</div>

<p>The apron skirt is very generally used in England,
and in this country is used by many for hunting and,
to some extent, for general riding. With this pattern
of skirt the rider must, of course, wear boots and
breeches. The skirt is entirely cut away on the side
<a name="Page_109" id="Page_109"> </a><!--125.png [full-page illo]-->
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_110" id="Page_110" title="110"> </a><!--126.png-->
next to the horse so that, when the rider is mounted,
her legs are in direct contact with the saddle. The
skirt is fastened along the right leg above the knee
with buttons and has a strap which passes under
the right knee. There is also a strap which passes
under the right foot and another strap which passes
under the left heel and holds the skirt in place.</p>

<p>The half apron skirt is similar to this but, instead
of being fastened to the right leg by buttons, it goes
under the thigh and the rider sits on it.</p>

<p>The skirt with patent fasteners is cut just like a
plain skirt, but on the right side and following the leg
from the knee down there is an open seam extending
around the pommels. This seam is fastened with
patent fasteners when the rider is off the horse, but
should be left open when she is mounted.</p>

<p>I consider the apron skirt the safest for use in
the hunting field, for, while in my own experience I
have not known of a woman being “hung up” with
a skirt with patent fasteners, I have heard of this
occurring. The awkwardness, however, of the apron
or half apron skirt, when one is out of the saddle,
makes it embarrassing for the wearer, so it is scarcely
to be recommended for ordinary riding.</p>

<p>The half apron pattern of skirt is quite as safe
as the apron and it is really more a matter of individual
fancy as to which of the two one should select.</p>
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_111" id="Page_111" title="111"> </a><!--127.png-->

<p>There are also skirts of the type with patent
fasteners which are fastened in the same way at the
waist, so that if the rider should be thrown and the
skirt should be caught in the saddle, the waistband
will give way and the rider will be entirely released
from the skirt.</p>

<p>Habit skirts should be kept from blowing and
“riding” by the use of two elastic loops, both on the
inside of the skirt, one in such a position as to pass
over the right toe, the other under the left heel.
These loops should be slipped into position as soon
as the rider is in place in the saddle. It is a mistake
to think that there is any danger from these loops,
for they are sure either to slip off the foot or to give
way in case of an accident.</p>

<p>In the saddle a woman should produce a broad-shouldered
and long-waisted effect, and the coat
should be cut with this principle in mind. Unless a
woman’s shoulders look wider than her hips, she will
never present a smart appearance on a horse. I
do not admire a small-waisted effect in the saddle.
Somehow it is inappropriate and looks uncomfortable.
The effect should be of broad shoulders, slimness,
neatness, and ease; of long lines rather than
curves.</p>

<p>The coat should be single-breasted, fastened with
five or three buttons, according to the wearer’s figure,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_112" id="Page_112" title="112"> </a><!--128.png-->
and also with regard to the use for which the
coat is intended.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="illus-112">
<img src="images/illus-112.jpg" class="photograph" width="387" height="500" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="small-caps">New Style Costume for Park Riding</span></div>
</div>

<p>Thus in the hunting-field, whatever the rider’s
figure, it is better to have five buttons, in order to
protect the rider as much as possible against rain, etc.
For hunting, and especially for use in cold weather
and for country wear, the collar of the coat should
be made to turn up and button over with a tab, and
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_113" id="Page_113" title="113"> </a><!--129.png-->
there should be a button under the left lapel, so that
the coat may be buttoned closely to the neck for
further protection.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="small-caps">Old Style (1887) Postilion Coat</span></div>
</div>

<p>With regard to length, the fashion of the time
must, of course, be followed. At present it is the
fashion to have coats long, so as to come about five
inches above the knee when the rider is standing.
Some will find it becoming to their figure to have
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_114" id="Page_114" title="114"> </a><!--130.png-->
coats even longer and some shorter, and we may
hope that the days of the tight-fitting postilion coats,
which make the rider look all hips, have passed
forever. The collar may be of velvet of the same
shade as the habit, of the material itself, or of gray,
black, or tan leather, according to the color of the
habit, but not of silk or satin. Personally, I do
not care for leather collars and think they are too
showy to be really smart. A left side breast pocket
and two side pockets are permissible. It is a good
plan to line the tails of the coat with rubber, so
that the sweat from the horse’s back will not soak
through the cloth.</p>

<p>The sleeves should be plain and finished at the
cuffs like a man’s, or the cuffs may be turned back
from two to three inches, according to the length of
arm, but should never be of velvet or any material
other than that of the coat itself.</p>

<p>Waistcoats are very smart, but not absolutely
necessary. For use in the hunting field and in cold
weather they are advisable, and should then be made
of a rather heavy material, and, in particular, the back
should be of flannel so as to protect the rider against
a chill. Waistcoats may be made of various fancy
or plaid materials, in heavy or light weights, which
are manufactured especially for the purpose. Single-breasted
waistcoats are smarter than double-breasted.</p>
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_115" id="Page_115" title="115"> </a><!--131.png-->

<p>The pockets may be made with or without lapels.
If the former, they should be real lapels or flaps coming
over the pockets, as they are meant to wear in
the hunting-field so as to prevent things in the pockets
from escaping. These pockets in the waistcoat are
very convenient for the watch, change, etc.</p>

<p>For the woman who does not ride much or is just
taking it up and is not sure whether she will enjoy
it, for summer use in the country and for beginners
and growing children, ready-made habits of good
style are to be found in the department stores.</p>

<p>For the woman who rides, however, it is most
advisable to have a habit built by a smart tailor
and made of the best materials. The cheaper materials
do not give good service and lose their shape.</p>

<p>For winter use, some heavy material which does
not stretch should be selected, such as melton, broadcloth,
heavy cheviot, or heavy whip-cord, and for
most women the best colors are black, black and gray,
brown, dark blue, dark green, and any dark, quiet
color which is becoming to the wearer. For park
riding in the winter, checks, plaids, and other pronounced
patterns are not suitable.</p>

<p>For medium weight habits for spring and fall
use, there is more freedom of choice. The rider can
always select something becoming in checks, medium
weight gray and brown cloths, light whip-cords,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_116" id="Page_116" title="116"> </a><!--132.png-->
and invisible stripes. The great point is to be sure
that the material selected is “tailor’s cloth,” for no
other cloth will stand the hard wear of riding.</p>

</div>

<p>For summer there is a much wider range of
choice. For very warm weather, khaki, duck, crash,
and linen habits are all suitable. They are all smart
and cool and stand tubbing, or else can be regularly
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_117" id="Page_117" title="117"> </a><!--133.png-->
scrubbed with a stiff hand brush and bath soap.
This saves the risk of their being shrunk or starched
out of shape by a careless laundress. It is essential
that habits for use in warm weather should be
of material that can be washed, and one should be
sure to have the material shrunk before it is made
up, else, when the rider puts it on after its first
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_118" id="Page_118" title="118"> </a><!--134.png-->
wetting, she will probably present a “grown-up-in-the-night”
appearance.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="illus-117">

<div class="caption"><span class="small-caps">A Smart Summer Habit</span></div>
</div>

<p>It is a very good plan with summer habits to
have two skirts made for each coat, as skirts become
soiled much more quickly. If one rides much in
the hot weather it is necessary to have at least three
summer habits, and the more one has the smarter
one’s appearance.</p>

<p>In London in the season, and throughout England
in the summer, many women wear a white linen
skirt with a dark coat or a dark cloth skirt with a
white linen coat. The former of these combinations
is very well suited to our climate, with its constant
changes, and also to the roads which have been oiled
for automobiles, as the oil ruins cloth skirts, while it
can be readily washed out of the linens. The combination
of a dark cloth skirt and a white linen coat
looks cooler than it is and is better suited to the
English climate than to ours.</p>

<p>For rainy or cold weather a rain coat or covert
coat is very serviceable. The former may be either
of the material of which the English rain coats are
made or of cravenetted cloth. Very few of the
tailors in this country make these rain coats, so it
is usually necessary to buy an imported one.</p>

<p>The English coats are so made as to shed the
water in front of the pommels, and do not allow it
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_119" id="Page_119" title="119"> </a><!--135.png-->
to collect. They have an inner lining which fastens
about the wrist with an elastic band and the collar
buttons over with a tab. They, therefore, are a
complete protection against the wet but, except for
use in very cold storms or in snow, are too hot for
general purposes in our climate.</p>

<p>A coat of cravenetted cloth will therefore be
found, perhaps, more serviceable. If intended as a
protection against the rain, it should be nearly as
long as the habit on the near side, and the back
should, of course, have a vent long enough to clear
the cantle.</p>

<p>For riding in cold weather many women find it
necessary to wear a top-coat, which may be made of
heavy covert cloth or of rough tweed or of any suitable
plain material such as a man would use.</p>

<p>Such a coat need not be as long as a rain coat,
but may be, if the rider desires additional protection.
The top-coat, of course, should be longer than
the habit coat, as nothing looks worse than to see
the skirts of a habit coat coming out under those of
the top-coat. The top-coat may be finished just
like a man’s, with patch pockets, etc., and should,
of course, have a collar that will turn up and button
over with a tab.</p>

<p>A serviceable coat for summer use in rainy weather
may be made of light weight check rubber cloth,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_120" id="Page_120" title="120"> </a><!--136.png-->
which is very smart and cooler than the imported
English rain coats.</p>

<p>The underclothes for riding should be as carefully
considered as the outer garments. Silk shirts
and full silk tights are best for riding, but, if full
tights are not worn, socks should be worn in place of
stockings, as the latter wrinkle under the right knee
and chafe. Garters, if tight, as they need to be,
stop the circulation, and supporters come directly
under the leaping horn. If silk tights are deemed
too extravagant, silk lisle or lisle tights, or boys’ long
balbriggan, lisle, or gauze merino drawers are a good
substitute.</p>

<p>Corsets or corset waists, if worn, should be loose
enough for absolute comfort and freedom, but women
who are accustomed to the support of heavy stays
should, when riding, wear equestrian corsets. To
present a mannish appearance in the saddle, short
corsets should be worn and, as I have said before,
the appearance of being laced should be entirely
avoided.</p>

<p>Either equestrian tights or riding breeches are
worn, and nowadays most women prefer the latter.</p>

<p>A woman’s riding breeches are made on the style
of a man’s and of similar material, the chief difference
being that if buttons are used to fasten them
below the knee, they should be placed either directly
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_121" id="Page_121" title="121"> </a><!--137.png-->
in front, which is smart but may be uncomfortable,
or on the inside of the right leg, so as to avoid rubbing
against the saddle. Instead of buttons, lacing
may be used and, if it is, both knees can be finished
alike, the same as a man’s. Two of the patterns
are illustrated on <a href="#illus-109">page 109</a>.</p>

<p>Breeches may be made of the same material as
the habit or of any suitable material such as a man
would wear. With a heavy winter habit it is, of
course, unnecessary to use as heavy material for the
breeches as would be the case if no skirt were worn.
For summer use, breeches may be made of white
linen, duck, or khaki.</p>

<p>For hunting and for rough country wear and for
cold weather, doeskin breeches are most serviceable
and very comfortable, and white breeches, such as
men wear in the hunting field, are correct and suitable
for almost any occasion.</p>

<p>Women who are inclined to fatness may prefer
equestrian tights, made of silk or wool, to
breeches.</p>

<p>Riding boots for women are made either stiff
legged, like a man’s, or soft legged, and with or without
tops. My preference is for a boot made throughout
of one material, and, for some occasions, stiff legs
are almost a necessity, while for others the soft legs
are more comfortable.</p>
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_122" id="Page_122" title="122"> </a><!--138.png-->

<p>For winter use, and for wear with black, blue,
green, or very dark gray habits, black boots look
much better than tan.</p>

<p>For the show ring and for park riding, patent-leather
stiff-legged boots are correct, and are better
suited to very formal occasions than plain calf boots.
Patent-leather boots should always be made with
stiff legs, as otherwise the varnish will crack. Plain
calf boots are more serviceable and more comfortable
than patent-leather for country riding, and are
correct for the hunting-field. Patent-leather boots
are not correct in the hunting-field, and, like most
other matters of correct form, this rule is founded
on common sense, for patent-leather boots tire the
feet and legs, and with them the feet are apt to
become very cold in bad weather. They are also
easily scratched and damaged in riding over rough
country.</p>

<p>For hunting and for polo, stiff-legged boots are
correct, as they are a great protection for the legs.</p>

<p>Tan boots are not correct in the show ring, except
for out-door shows in the summer, nor are they
correct at any time in the hunting-field. They look
better with summer habits, and with any light colored
habit, particularly with light grays, browns,
and khaki. Black patent-leather boots, hot as they
are, look very smart with white linen habits.</p>
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_123" id="Page_123" title="123"> </a><!--139.png-->

<p>The loose-legged boots, which resemble a jockey’s
boot, are being worn now by both men and women
for park and country riding, especially in summer.
They are cooler than stiff-legged boots, but give
scarcely any protection.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="illus-123">

<a href="images/illus-123-large.jpg" class="enlarge">View larger image.</a>
</div>
</div>

<p>A very good type of serviceable boot for rough
country wear, is one which laces over the instep and
ankle, and, in its general cut, resembles the field boot
or shooting boot. As these can be loosened over the
instep, they do not bind the foot or bring discomfort
after a long day’s wear, and they are much more
comfortable for walking. They have the same objection,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_124" id="Page_124" title="124"> </a><!--140.png-->
however, as the loose-legged boots; that is,
they do not protect the leg in rough work.</p>

<p>Many women wear, in the country, tan laced
boots or leather leggings, either of the straight kind
or what are known as leather puttees. These are
the same as a man’s except that the legging of the
right leg should buckle on the inside, for the same
reason as I have mentioned in respect to the buttons
on the breeches. It is, however, much more important
in the case of the leggings, as the buckles,
if placed on the right side, would come directly in
contact with the saddle and cause the rider great
discomfort.</p>

<p>Whether boots or leggings are worn, they should
be of a length sufficient to come well up over the
breeches, but should be about two inches shorter
than a man’s boot or leggings would be, because the
right knee in the side-saddle is bent at much more
of an angle than it is when riding astride, and if the
boot is too long it is very apt to pinch the flesh between
the pommel and the top of the boot.</p>

<p>The boots should be fastened with catgut or cord
loops in the back, engaging with buttons sewed in
the breeches, and one may also have straps or “garters”
passing through loops in the back of the boots
and attached in front by cord loops to the second
button on the breeches. These loops and straps
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_125" id="Page_125" title="125"> </a><!--141.png-->
prevent the boots from slipping down and the breeches
from slipping up, and from twisting.</p>

<p>Boots, if not made by one’s own boot maker,
should be a size larger than those ordinarily worn,
as boots tight in the foot, particularly of the stiff-legged
kind, are, at the end of a long day, instruments
of torture, and I have known of many cases
where they have had to be cut off because of the
feet having swollen. Whatever kind of boot is worn,
it should fit very closely about the calf and should
be smaller at the top so as to conform to the shape
of the leg. Many women consider the fit of the boots
as unimportant, not realizing to what an extent they
may be seen, and how uncomfortable, too, loose boots
are for walking.</p>

<p>Under the coat should be worn a plain or plaited
shirt of any pattern or material which may suit the
wearer’s fancy, provided only that it is in keeping
with the general mannish style of the whole costume.
Silk shirts are very suitable and quite correct at all
times. The cuffs should be fastened with sleeve-links.</p>

<p>For neckwear I prefer white Ascot stocks. These
stocks should be made of very thin material which
is hard to find. The ready-made ones are usually
much too thick and clumsy and cannot be tied neatly.
They should never be laundered stiff, and in the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_126" id="Page_126" title="126"> </a><!--142.png-->
front a piece of celluloid is inserted on the inside, or
the stock may be worn over a stiff standing collar
of the same height. The stock should be fastened
with an appropriate pin. The bar pins look particularly
neat.</p>

<p>Instead of white Ascot stocks, stocks in colors,
tying in a bow, are very smart, particularly for summer,
and they are not so warm as the Ascots. They
come in plain colors and polka dots and are much
worn in England. Of course, they look best when
worn over a high standing collar.</p>

<p>Instead of a stock, it is equally correct to wear a
high turnover or standing white linen collar with an
Ascot or a four-in-hand tie, or a bow tie which is
quite smart for almost any occasion. One should
never wear a “ready tied” stock or tie. They are
essentially bad form.</p>

<p>If a belt is worn it should be of plain calf leather
or pigskin with a plain buckle.</p>

<p>While for city riding, whatever the weather, a
coat must be worn; in summer in the country many
women ride without one for coolness’ sake. When
riding without a coat, it looks much better to wear
a belt, which should pass through loops sewed on the
band of the skirt.</p>

<p>The hair should be done plainly and low on the
head, either braided or securely coiled. For young
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_127" id="Page_127" title="127"> </a><!--143.png-->
girls only, a hair ribbon, which should be black, is
permissible. Be sure that the hair is arranged securely,
for nothing looks worse or is more uncomfortable
when riding than untidy hair.</p>

<p>The correct hat for use in winter is a black derby,
except on very formal occasions, such as the show
ring or formal park riding, when a silk hat should
be worn, if becoming. If not, however, a derby is
equally correct, but these are the only two hats which
are correct for formal riding. A silk hat is also worn
in the hunting field, where it is strictly correct. Many
women wear in the hunting field a specially constructed
stiff derby intended as a protection to the
head in the case of a fall, or of coming in contact
with branches.</p>

<p>Many women find the “Continental” hat more becoming
than the derby, and it is perfectly permissible
for all but very formal occasions. It is never, however,
correct in the show ring or in the hunting field.</p>

<p>For all occasions when a habit of a color other
than black, dark blue, or dark green is permissible,
a derby hat may be worn of a shade to match the
habit. Thus, a light or dark brown derby, if becoming,
looks very smart with a light or dark brown
habit, and a gray hat with checks.</p>

<p>For summer wear the plain straw or black sailor or
Panama is correct for all occasions, but the Panama,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_128" id="Page_128" title="128"> </a><!--144.png-->
if worn, should be perfectly plain and, particularly,
should have a plain ribbon. These styles of hats are
much better suited for wear with linen or crash habits
than derbys or Continentals. For wear in the summer
the sombrero is comfortable, but I do not consider
it very fit.</p>

<p>All riding hats should be large enough to set well
down on the head, like a man’s, and should be kept
in place by a rather broad elastic. If this is sewn a
trifle nearer the front of the hat than usual, it will
hold the hat better than if sewn exactly in the middle.</p>

<p>Hat pins should never be used in riding. They
look out of keeping, and in case of an accident are
very dangerous. It is quite correct to wear a hat
guard, but it should be of the kind that fastens to
the back brim of the hat, with the hanger inside of
the coat collar, and the hanger should be short
enough to keep the hat, if blown off the head, from
striking the horse. This precaution is very important,
as I have often known of horses starting to run
from being struck by the hat.</p>

<p>Riding gloves should either be tan, dog-skin, white
buckskin, or white chamois. They should be heavy,
hand sewn, have either one or two buttons, and
should be a size or two larger than those usually
worn.</p>

<p>White gloves are correct for all occasions, and I
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_129" id="Page_129" title="129"> </a><!--145.png-->
think look smarter than tan. They should always
be worn with white habits.</p>

<p>For the hunting field and the show ring, heavy
white buckskin gloves are strictly correct, but they
do not wash well and, as they have to be pipe-clayed
to look white, the pipe-clay comes off on one’s habit
and proves very annoying. I have found white
chamois gloves the best for use as they can be washed
while on the hands in tepid water with a scrubbing
brush and bath soap. When dry they should be put
on, rubbed softly together, and they will then be
practically as good as new. Buckskin gloves should
be kept on trees to dry after washing or they will
lose their shape and shrink.</p>

<p>Driving gloves which are reinforced over the
fingers where the reins are held in driving, are not
suitable for riding. They are too stiff and clumsy
and one loses the “feel” of the horse’s mouth.</p>

<p>It is always correct to carry either a whip, stock,
or crop, and it is advisable to do so, both because
the horse may need punishment and in order to give
the right hand something to do.</p>

<p>Light cutting whips are best when riding a green
horse or one that is apt to require punishment.
Crops, of course, should always be carried in the
hunting field, and for other occasions plain sticks
are equally correct.</p>
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_130" id="Page_130" title="130"> </a><!--146.png-->

<p>It is not safe for a woman, unless she is an experienced
rider, to wear a sharp spur, and one should
never be worn except with an open skirt, as it is almost
certain to catch in a plain skirt. The spur, if worn,
should be plain and of the same pattern as a man’s.</p>

<p>No jewelry should be worn
in riding except the pin in the
tie and the cuff links.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="illus-130">
<img src="images/illus-130.jpg" width="195" height="400" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="small-caps">Puttees</span></div>
</div>

<p>The under dress for cross-saddle
riding should be the
same as for the side-saddle.
For the outer dress the only
style that I consider correct is
loose riding breeches, polo legged
boots, and a long coat. The
divided skirt always looks to me
out of place, and any woman
who wants to wear a skirt had
better ride in the side-saddle.
For a long riding trip in the mountains or for
roughing it or for any occasion when a woman is apt
to have to walk as well as to ride, a short divided
skirt, coming only to the knees, such as Western
women wear, is appropriate, but I should not consider
it appropriate for ordinary riding in the East.</p>

<p>Stiff boots are preferable to leggings because they
do not show the shape of the leg and are more of a
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_131" id="Page_131" title="131"> </a><!--147.png-->
protection than soft legged boots. The boots should
be as long as a man’s for cross-saddle riding and
should show three buttons on the breeches. They
should be tight in the leg and fastened in the way I
have described on <a href="#Page_121">page 121</a>.</p>

<p>The breeches should be cut exactly like a man’s
except that they should be more baggy above the
knees. They must fit very closely at the seat and
about the waist and should fit very tightly below the
knee. They should always be reinforced with buckskin
on the inside of the knees. Appropriate breeches
are shown in the illustration on <a href="#illus-109">page 109</a>.</p>

<p>The coat should be single-breasted, with three
or five buttons, according to the wearer’s figure and
personal fancy, and rather loose fitting, quite long,
with very full skirts coming below the knee when
mounted. The skirts of the coat are kept in place
by a tab which engages with the third button from
the top on the breeches, just above the boots. The
coat should be opened enough in the back to clear
the cantle, so that the skirts will fall on either side of
the horse. With the skirts so fastened at the knees,
the thighs and upper legs are concealed and nothing
is visible but a smart boot.</p>

<p>I consider this far the smartest, the most comfortable,
the most modest, and the safest costume
for cross-saddle riding.</p>

SADDLES AND BRIDLES</h3>


<p><span class="upper">Much</span> discrimination is required in the selection
of a side-saddle. In order to be comfortable
it must fit both the rider and the horse,
a condition harder to find than one would imagine.</p>

<p>The best makers carry different lengths of saddles
in stock. The shortest measure eighteen inches from
the front to the cantle, and the longest twenty-four
inches. With each of these different lengths there
are standard widths, and I cannot overstate the
importance of a woman choosing a saddle that is
suited to her conformation. On <a href="#illus-140">page 140</a> of this book
will be found a diagram, with instructions for measurement,
so that if a good maker is not available
the saddle may be ordered by mail, but I would
advise any woman who wishes to select a saddle to
take some experienced woman rider with her to the
saddler’s and rely on her advice, as I have known
many women to choose the wrong size of saddle and
thus be rendered very uncomfortable. Trying a
saddle in the shop is very different from riding in it
on a horse, and it takes a great deal of experience
to pick out what you require.</p>
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_134" id="Page_134" title="134"> </a><!--150.png-->

<p>A side-saddle, in this country at least, costs quite
a bit of money, but a good one, with proper care, will
last for a lifetime, and, with a little adjustment, can
be made to fit almost any horse. While there are
hundreds of different makes of side-saddles on the
market, the really good ones are very few.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="illus-134">
<img src="images/illus-134.jpg" width="353" height="400" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="small-caps">Lady’s Park and Hunting Saddle</span></div>
</div>

<p>The best English side-saddles are really in a class
by themselves, and no such saddles are made in this
country except by the English saddlers, and they
use only imported English pigskin. The English,
whether imported or made here of English material,
cost only a little more than the American
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_135" id="Page_135" title="135"> </a><!--151.png-->
saddles, and they are so far superior that there is
no question in my mind but that they should be
one’s choice.</p>

<p>In its construction a woman’s saddle differs from
a man’s. As it is made to sit on instead of to bestride,
the seat is made as level as possible, and the
best saddles have, if any, only a slight dip of, say,
from one to one and a half inches. I find a saddle
with this slight dip more secure for hunting and for
riding very green horses, but the saddle should not
have a greater dip than this, and many women find
a level seat without any dip perfectly comfortable.
I prefer a level saddle for all ordinary use, and the
dip, if any, must come from the elevation of the cantle,
and not from the hollowing out of the seat or
from the elevation of the front. The old style side-saddle,
with a “dished out” seat covered with doeskin,
has been entirely abandoned, for the safety of
the rider and the comfort of the horse.</p>

<p>The best makers use pigskin for covering the
seats of nearly all their saddles. In France, however,
many women use buckskin and some of these saddles
are used in this country. In France these saddles
are pipe-clayed and look very smart with a light
habit, and if one is able to have two or more saddles
in one’s stable, I know of no objection to using this
French type of saddle on occasion.</p>
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_136" id="Page_136" title="136"> </a><!--152.png-->

<p>The saddle-flaps should also be made of genuine
pigskin. Most makers use pigskin to cover the
leaping iron and pommel. Some of the best saddles,
however, have these covered with buckskin, which
gives them a safer and more clinging feeling.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="small-caps">Side-Saddle with Wide Pommels and Safety Flap</span><br />

When the flap is raised the stirrup comes off</div>
</div>

<p>The greatest improvement in the modern side-saddle
is the cutting far back of the gullet plate,
which leaves the withers covered only by the continuation
of the near flap. This form of construction
not only keeps the seat of the saddle level, but
makes the rider much more comfortable, as it enables
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_137" id="Page_137" title="137"> </a><!--153.png-->
her to have her thigh horizontal instead of the
knee being raised as it was in the old style of “dished
out” saddles with a high front. Moreover, it has
the great advantage of freeing the horse’s withers
from pressure, and helps a bit toward keeping his
back cool. The cooler the back is kept the freer it
will be from soreness and chafing.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="small-caps">Side-Saddle with Stirrup Adjustable from Off Side</span></div>
</div>

<p>The frame of the saddle is called the “tree.”
The tree of the standard saddles is of a standard
width, and the fitting of the saddle to the horse’s
back is secured not from using different sized trees
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_138" id="Page_138" title="138"> </a><!--154.png-->
but by padding. Horses’ backs differ greatly both
in width and sharpness, so that the saddle should
always be fitted to the particular horse on which it
is to be most used. This should be done by an
experienced and competent saddler, and a proper fit
secured before the saddle is bought or accepted.
With a properly fitted saddle, saddle pads and cloths
should never be necessary. They look clumsy, they
are liable to slip out of place, they collect sand and
dirt, and even the best of them heat the horse’s back.
If some kind of saddle pad is required on account of
a sore back, or an ill-fitting saddle, or if, for instance,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_139" id="Page_139" title="139"> </a><!--155.png-->
one is using one’s own saddle on a strange horse that
it does not fit, by far the best pad to use is a sheepskin,
cut the same size as the saddle and worn with
the woolly side next to the horse’s back. Sheepskins
are readily washed and do not heat the horse’s
back nearly as much as the ordinary felt saddle pad.</p>

</div>

<p>Saddles are lined either with leather, with plain
Holland linen, or with heavy white serge. Of the
three I greatly prefer the leather because it is cooler
for the horse’s back, is more easily cleaned, looks
far smarter, and is more durable. If the saddle
fits the horse properly the leather lining will never
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_140" id="Page_140" title="140"> </a><!--156.png-->
rub him, but it must be kept soft by frequent
oiling.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="illus-140">

<div class="caption"><span class="small-caps">Diagram for Measuring Side-Saddle</span>
<a href="images/illus-140-large.jpg" class="enlarge">View larger image.</a>
</div>
</div>

<p>In my opinion, linen is next best, but it does not
wear as well as leather, and serge, which is in general
use and is found in most saddles, is not as good a
material for lining as either leather or linen. It is
not durable, it becomes very dirty, it is hard to dry,
and, unless it is kept clean and dry, it rubs the
horse’s back badly.</p>

<p>As a substitute for a leather lining and in order
to prevent the serge lining from chafing a tender
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_141" id="Page_141" title="141"> </a><!--157.png-->
back, many riders adopt the expedient in vogue in
India and use a leather saddle cloth called “numnah.”
These are good for use in hot weather and keep the
horse’s back much cooler than would the serge lining,
and save chafing. They are cut the exact size of the
saddle and fastened to it by straps which pass under
the flap. They must be kept soft by constant oiling,
otherwise they fail in their purpose.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="small-caps">3. Corded Girth</span></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The girths are made either of webbing or of
leather. The Fitz-William girth is the safest and
neatest for a woman. This consists of one very broad
girth, some five inches wide, with two buckles at each
end which engage the two outside billets on either
side of the saddle. This girth goes next to the horse’s
body, and another girth, about half as wide and a
trifle shorter, passes over the first girth&mdash;on which it
is held in position by a leather loop just below the
buckles&mdash;and terminates in a single buckle which
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_142" id="Page_142" title="142"> </a><!--158.png-->
engages the middle of the three billets on either side
of the saddle.</p>

<p>The advantages of this type of girth are that it
is very strong and safe, and it is much easier with it
to girth the horse as tight as is necessary for the side-saddle
than it is with two or three separate narrow
girths, each independent of the other, such as are commonly
used in livery stables and riding schools.</p>

<p>In girthing with the Fitz-William, first the wide
girth is drawn tight, and then the narrow girth, and
it will be found that the narrow girth can be tightened
on the wide one so that, after it has been drawn,
the wide one can be taken up two or three holes, and
then the narrow one can be taken up again, and so
the horse cannot, by inflating himself, prevent tight
girthing.</p>

<p>For the show ring, for hunting, and for park riding
the girths must be either of leather or of white
webbing.</p>

<p>For country use brown webbing girths are permissible,
but they never look well and are liked
chiefly by lazy grooms.</p>

<p>Needless to say, white girths must be kept scrupulously
clean and pipe-clayed.</p>

<p>I do not approve of braided horse-hide girths,
nor of the Western “cinch” for use with the conventional
English side-saddle. The “cinch,” of
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_143" id="Page_143" title="143"> </a><!--159.png-->
course, is a very useful device for use with a cowboy’s
saddle, but there is no justification for its use with
the side-saddle.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="illus-143">
<img src="images/illus-143.jpg" width="351" height="500" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="small-caps">Adjusting Stirrup from Off Side</span></div>
</div>

<p>The balance strap, which is the strap running
from the girth billets on the near side to a ring fastened
on the off side of the cantle, serves to hold
the saddle in position. It must not, however, be
strapped too tight or it will pull the saddle too far
over to the right and fatigue the horse unnecessarily.
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_144" id="Page_144" title="144"> </a><!--160.png-->
Some of the best English side-saddles now are so
made that, when ridden by a very good rider, a
balance strap is not necessary. This is a great advantage,
as many horses are ticklish and the balance
strap annoys them, and, besides, the side-saddle without
a balance strap is smarter, on the general principle
that the less unnecessary harness there is on a
saddle-horse the better.</p>

<p>It is most important that the bridle and reins
should be made of the very best quality of leather
throughout, and of course, when they are, they are
not cheap, but, on the other hand, they last so much
longer that it is economy to buy the best at the outset.
Cheap leather may give way at a critical moment,
and, in any case, the low grade of leather will
become hard and stiff, will crack, and will not take
the proper polish. The leather, both of bridle and
reins, should be thin and pliable, but this should be
the result of pressing and working by the strapper.
The reins especially must always be pliable, as thick
reins tire and hurt both the hands of the rider and
the mouth of the horse, and with them one cannot
have that lightness and firmness of touch by means
of which alone a horse should be controlled by a
woman. I cannot insist upon this too strongly, as
many fine mouths have been ruined through the use
of thick and heavy reins.</p>
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_145" id="Page_145" title="145"> </a><!--161.png-->

<p>The reins for a woman’s use should be a little
narrower than for a man’s, and should be in proportion
to the relative size of her hands. Women
with very small hands may find it necessary to have
reins especially made for them. The width of the
reins should be such that, when held in the position
described, the fingers can be fully bent and the edges
of the reins held between the second joint of the
fingers and the cushions of the hands. If they are
too wide, the fingers cannot be fully closed, which
presents a very awkward appearance. If a rider
has very long fingers the reins should not be too
narrow, for, if they are, they cannot be grasped on
the edges, and they slip through the fingers. Therefore,
women with exceptionally long fingers usually
find it better to use a man’s bridle.</p>

<p>With the Weymouth curb and bridoon a double
bridle is, of course, used. This is illustrated in the
cut and the names of the various parts given. The
buckles should be leather covered and should be
square rather than round. The cheek pieces and
bridoon head may be buckled with the curb and
snaffle bits, respectively, or be stitched. The latter
looks much neater, but it makes the bits hard to
clean and they cannot be changed.</p>

<p>The latest method is to have an invisible hook
on the inside of the cheek pieces, which is similar to
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_146" id="Page_146" title="146"> </a><!--162.png-->
the hook used on certain types of the best side-saddles,
in place of the buckle for shortening the stirrup
leather. The cheek piece, where it passes through
the ring, has stitching on it, and, without a close
inspection, one would not notice whether the cheek
pieces were stitched or hooked. I recommend this
appliance very highly, as it wears better than buckles
and looks just as well as stitching.</p>

</div>
</div>

<a class="pagenum" name="Page_147" id="Page_147" title="147"> </a><!--163.png-->

<p>The reins should be fastened to the rings in the
same way as the cheek pieces, whether by buckles,
by stitching, or by the invisible hook which I have
described.</p>

<p>When the standing martingale is used it is fastened
to the noseband or to the cavesson, which many
use in its place.</p>

<p>With horses that rear or are inclined to “star
gaze” a woman should always, except in the hunting
field, use a standing martingale. It keeps their
heads down, gives the rider better control, and prevents
rearing.</p>

<p>The standing martingale looks better if hung
from a breastplate in the same manner as a running
martingale. Standing martingales cannot be used
in hunting, as they prevent a horse from jumping
freely. So in hunting with a horse that needs a
martingale a running martingale should be used.
This is attached to the front of the breastplate and
has two branches ending in rings, through which the
snaffle reins are passed. In front of these rings there
should be leather stops on the reins to prevent their
buckles from catching in the rings.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="illus-148">

<div class="caption"><span class="small-caps">Correctly Saddled and Bridled for Hunting</span><br />

Note the breastplate and cavesson</div>
</div>

<p>Running martingales are chiefly used in the hunting
field and in jumping, for in jumping a horse must
have his head free, and a tight standing martingale
would prevent him from throwing his head forward at
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_148" id="Page_148" title="148"> </a><!--164.png-->
the take off, and so not only prevent him from using
his strength to the best advantage, but would tend
to throw him off his balance. Running martingales,
however, are not nearly as effectual in preventing a
horse from rearing, and when they are used it requires
a very considerable amount of strength on the
part of the rider to keep the horse’s head down, while,
of course, the standing martingale keeps the horse’s
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_149" id="Page_149" title="149"> </a><!--165.png-->
head down without any exertion on the part of the
rider.</p>

<p>If a standing martingale is used, be sure that it is
not fastened too tight; it should be loose enough to
allow the horse quite a little play with his head in
its natural position. If it is tighter than this the
horse, when the reins are loose, will put his head in
its natural position, then feel the pressure of the martingale
and think that he is being backed. He will
thereupon back, and the more you give him his
head by loosening the reins, the more, through attempting
to raise his head, he will feel the pressure
of the martingale and will keep on backing. Under
these circumstances, the only thing you can do is to
gather him lightly with the curb, which will bring
his head in and relieve the pressure of the martingale,
then urge him forward, or, if you want him to stand,
keep a light pressure on the curb so as to prevent the
martingale from being tight.</p>

<p>The breastplate, used with nearly all horses by
women in the hunting-field, should be used at all
times with a horse that is “tucked up” like a greyhound.
In fact, many riders use breastplates at all
times with nearly all horses, and, except in the show
ring or in park riding where they are not considered
good form, I think they should be generally used with
women’s saddles. They hold the saddle in place,

<p>The breastplate not only holds the saddle firmly
in place, but it also keeps it from turning, prevents
the girths from slipping back on the horse’s belly,
distributes part of the weight of the saddle on the
horse’s shoulders instead of having it all on the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_152" id="Page_152" title="152"> </a><!--168.png-->
girths, and gives the rider a feeling of security and
confidence.</p>

<p>A few horses have such wide chests and some
such tender skins that a breastplate is apt to gall
them.</p>

<p>The best bits for a woman to use are the curb and
snaffle. The curb bit in general use is of the Weymouth
pattern, as illustrated above (see cut No. 1,
<a href="#illus-150">page 150</a>). The snaffle is jointed (see cut No. 12,
<a href="#illus-150">page 150</a>). Most horses go better with a curb bit
with a slight port, such as No. 2, <a href="#illus-150">page 150</a>, though
personally I like the pattern illustrated in No. 1, same
page, above, quite as well, if not better. For horses
with very tender mouths or with sore mouths, the
curb bit may be covered with rubber. Other horses,
again, go better with a jointed curb, and old horses,
whose mouths are so hard that they cannot be
brought back to their original condition, may require
the use of a heavy port or other device which will
cause them pain when the curb rein is tightened.</p>

<p>These various devices are illustrated above. For
hunters, for pullers, for polo ponies, and for Southern
gaited horses, various kinds of bits are used, but I
shall not attempt to describe them here. They are
fully treated in many of the standard books on riding
and do not belong in a book devoted to riding and
driving for women.</p>
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_153" id="Page_153" title="153"> </a><!--169.png-->

<p>I shall add a few hints, gleaned largely from my
own experience, which may not be found in other
books on the general subject.</p>

<p>The normal position of the bit, whether curb or
snaffle, or both, is in the space between the teeth
called the “bars,” about two inches below the eyeteeth
in the mare and the tushes in the gelding.
This brings the curb chain to bear on the sensitive
flesh of the lower jaw where the pressure is most
effective. If the curb is too high, the chain bears on
the jawbone which, at that point, is only covered by
skin. This skin readily becomes calloused, so that
the curb chain has almost no effect. If the curb is
too low, the horse will be able to get his tongue over
the bit and keep it there, so that control will be lost
and the cheek straps will be too loose, and the snaffle,
unless it has very large rings, may be pulled through
the horse’s mouth.</p>

<p>Many horses have a bad habit of getting their
tongues over the bit. A horse with his tongue in
this position is quite uncontrollable, and he must be
broken of the habit at any cost. Most horses will
be cured by taking up the cheek straps and thus
raising the bits in the mouth. This, however, may
bring the curb chain too high, as above stated. If it
does, or if this method is not successful, it may be
necessary to resort to one of the patterns of curb bits
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_154" id="Page_154" title="154"> </a><!--170.png-->
designed to prevent the horse from getting his tongue
over, such as the gridiron, No. 12, <a href="#illus-150">page 150</a>, which
has a ring which is passed over the horse’s tongue.</p>

<p>A temporary device which may be used, except in
the show ring, is to put a rubber band over the port
in the curb and around the horse’s tongue. It must,
of course, not be tight or it will stop the circulation,
but it diverts the horse’s attention and, of course,
prevents him from bringing his tongue over the
bit.</p>

<p>If a horse is inclined to lag, or go up against the
bit, raise the snaffle in his mouth and lower the
curb.</p>

<p>In the ordinary adjustment of the bits, the curb
chain should be fastened so that, when hanging naturally,
you can slip two fingers under the chain without
disturbing the position of the bit, but if the animal
has a hard mouth the chain may be tightened enough
to give good control. No definite rule can, of course,
be laid down. Beginners, however, are particularly
cautioned to have their curb chains looser than I
have indicated, as, until they have acquired “hands”
and have entirely given up the habit of holding on
by the reins, they cannot with safety either to themselves
or their horses ride with the chain at all tight.</p>

<p>If a horse has been spoiled and his mouth is
so calloused or “hard” that he cannot be controlled
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_155" id="Page_155" title="155"> </a><!--171.png-->
even with a tight curb, and you still want
to ride him, the chain may be twisted, or one
of the punishing types of bit may be used, such
as those above illustrated (Nos. 19 and 20, <a href="#illus-150">page 150</a>).
Twisting the chain or using such a bit will make
his mouth all the harder, but will enable the rider
to control him.</p>

<p>While the Mexicans and Indians use very cruel
bits and ride only on the curb, they necessarily ride
with light hands; otherwise they would break the
horses’ mouths.</p>
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_156" id="Page_156" title="156"> </a><!--172.png-->

<p>If a horse pulls more on one side of his mouth
than on the other, drop the bits on the side opposite
to that on which he pulls. If horses have had the
advantage of proper training and intelligent riding,
they should have no “mouth tricks,” such as sticking
their tongues out on one side. If they are continually
fretting with their tongues and lips and
heads, it is probable that there is something the matter
with their teeth or that they have some soreness
or irritation inside of their mouths. Horses
do not do things of this kind without cause, and
as soon as anything of this kind is observed the
mouth should be thoroughly inspected and steps
taken to remedy the trouble immediately. Horses
often have trouble with their teeth very much
as we do. Usually a “vet.” will be able to remedy
any condition of that kind, but if not, it may
be necessary to call in a horse dentist. If trouble
of this kind is not attended to, the symptom may
become a habit or a trick very hard to break
and result in spoiling a horse’s appearance and
manners.</p>

THE SADDLE HORSE</h3>


<p><span class="upper">In</span> writing my description of the lady’s saddle
horse I find that, of all the horses I have ever seen,
I have not yet found one that eclipses, or even
equals, “Lady Bonnie.” I have described her before,
and all the change that is needed is in the
tense, which, alas! must now be in the past. When
asked for a perfect type of lady’s saddle horse,
I close my eyes and think of her. She may have
had her faults, but who has not? To my mind she
came as near perfection as any horse in the world.
Her beautiful walk, perfectly balanced trot, and
straight and delightful canter, made her a joy to ride.
Her well-crested, lengthy neck, giving room for plenty
of rein; her sloping shoulders and beautifully defined
withers meant for keeping the saddle in place; her
back of just the right length to make the saddle
look in proportion; her smoothly turned quarters,
with tail set high, carrying out the perfection of
her top line; her small head, wide between the eyes;
her tiny well-set and well-carried ears, combined
with the fineness and beauty of her coat, like black
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_158" id="Page_158" title="158"> </a><!--174.png-->
panne velvet, completed her magnificent effect of
breeding. Her intelligence, her eagerness to do her
part, her great though perfectly tractable spirit, and
her wonderful manners made it a pleasure to know
her and a privilege to be her friend.</p>

<p>A lady’s saddle horse should be of solid color,
black, chestnut, bay, or brown. White pasterns,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_159" id="Page_159" title="159"> </a><!--175.png-->
or a star or snip of white on the face, make a very
attractive “trimming up.” Personally, I do not consider
white-legged or bald-faced horses so suitable
for women, because they look “flashy.” While of
course color has nothing to do with conformation or
the other qualities most to be considered in a lady’s
saddle horse, it has everything to do with the points
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_160" id="Page_160" title="160"> </a><!--176.png-->
of a horse for the show ring, where no piebald or
flashily marked horse would stand a chance in a
ladies’ class.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="small-caps">English Type of Lady’s Park Hack</span></div>
</div>

<p>The only gaits used in the show ring, and generally
for park riding in the East, are the walk, trot,
and canter. The walk should be quick, yet without
tendency to jigjog; the trot square, well balanced,
and with no hint of mixed gaits. There should be
plenty of “all-round action,” of the hocks quite as
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_161" id="Page_161" title="161"> </a><!--177.png-->
much as of the knees, but of course not the “high
action” of the carriage horse. The canter should
be free and easy, but not too high, and should always
be a canter&mdash;not a shuffling go-between, nor should
it be so fast as to border on a run.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="small-caps">Light-weight Thoroughbred Lady’s Riding Horse

</div>

<p>The thoroughbred should be the ideal saddle
horse, as he is fashioned by nature for that purpose
alone. In England this is the type of “riding horse”
most in vogue, and in this country he may, in a few
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_162" id="Page_162" title="162"> </a><!--178.png-->
years, as he already has there, supplant the park
hack type. However delightful he may be in the
country or in the hunting-field, he is not really
suitable for park riding, where a collected trot is
essential and where his excitability gives the rider
more than she wants. It must be borne in mind
that the conditions of riding in England are entirely
different from what they are in this country. Here
we ride for exercise; there they hunt for exercise
and ride for rest. Therefore, what they want for
riding is a horse with very easy gaits who does not
give the rider any exertion. In England there is
very little riding on hard roads, as there is here.
They almost always ride over turf and they have
bridle paths on nearly all the roads. The English
“riding horse” I have referred to is a thoroughbred
or three-quarter bred, and the trot is not one of his
gaits. His canter is very easy and he gives the
Englishwoman just what she wants in the way of rest
and fresh air. With us, however, but few women
hunt, and when they ride they want exercise and
want, therefore, a horse that will give them more
to do. They find this in a horse with a good swinging
trot, but they would not find it in the thoroughbred.</p>

<p>A very strong strain of thoroughbred blood is
needed to produce the best type of saddle horse and,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_163" id="Page_163" title="163"> </a><!--179.png-->
aside from their suitableness for park riding, many
thoroughbreds, properly trained and judiciously selected
as to conformation, make horse show winners.</p>

<p>Riding a thoroughbred is altogether different
from riding any other kind of a horse. It is then
that all the niceties of the art of riding are called
into play, not so much as regards the seat, for his gaits
are easy, but the hands must be more than usually
light, more than usually firm, and more than usually
quick in their communication between the mind
of the rider and the mouth of the horse. In fact, I
am going to say the mind of the horse too, for of
good gray matter the thoroughbred possesses an
ample share. Thoroughbreds are so excitable and
so hot-blooded that only experienced riders with
good hands can manage them, and they are very unsafe
for those who have not mastered the art. They
are hard to manage when ridden in company with
other horses, and they are so fussy and unreliable
that they afford but little pleasure except to an accomplished
horsewoman.</p>

<p>Next in order to the thoroughbred comes the
hunter. Were I limited to one horse I would, of all
others, select the hunter because of his general
all-round usefulness. He is thoroughly suitable for
park riding, he can be driven, he can be hacked, and
his jumping qualities put him in a class by himself.
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_164" id="Page_164" title="164"> </a><!--180.png-->
There are so many different types of hunters that
one cannot fairly say that any particular type is the
best. All depends on the country to be hunted and
whether the horse is wanted for hunting only or for
general utility as well.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="small-caps">Thoroughbred Hunter (Sunday Morning)</span></div>
</div>

<p>Probably the best hunters are the Irish. They
are up to more weight, they have more substance,
greater endurance, and, for their own country, are
the safest jumpers in the world. These Irish hunters
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_165" id="Page_165" title="165"> </a><!--181.png-->
have been bred and hunted in Ireland for generations
and are natural born jumpers for banks, but
in Ireland they do not have fences, such as we know
them, nor do they have such high jumps in the
hunting-field as we have. So Irish hunters are not
suited for hunting in this country until they have been
thoroughly trained over our fences. The English
and the Canadian hunters are more accustomed to
timber and jump higher than the Irish.</p>

</div>
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_166" id="Page_166" title="166"> </a><!--182.png-->

<p>Hunting in the vicinity of the great cities of
the East has changed entirely in this country in the
last fifteen years, and the types of horses that were
suited to former conditions are not fast enough and
do not jump high enough for the pace we have now.
The present tendency in the East, since there are
no longer wild foxes to be hunted, is to turn hunting
into steeple-chasing, and the only horses that will
carry their riders fast enough and safely over the
courses as they are laid out are thoroughbreds or
three-quarter breds.</p>

<p>In other parts of the country, of course, the country
is not so stiff and the thoroughbred type is not
essential.</p>

<p>In the South, particularly in Virginia, the best
traditions of the hunting field have been upheld since
the earliest times, and there is the home of the best
hunting to be had in this country. There has been
as yet no invasion by barbed wire. The country
has not been exploited or commercialized, and the
farmers are of an entirely different class from those
to be found in the neighborhood of the great cities
or in the North. As a general rule they are heartily
in sympathy with hunting; many of them follow the
hounds and breed hunters, and even use them on their
farms. In fact, the hunter is the general type of horse
to be found throughout that section of the country.</p>
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_167" id="Page_167" title="167"> </a><!--183.png-->

<div class="caption"><span class="small-caps">Show Winner in Park Hack Classes (Sonia)</span></div>
</div>

<p>The hunter is the one kind of mount for a woman
in which beauty, though desirable, is not a requisite.
Rather does one seek in hunters breeding, courage,
and intelligence, and the greatest of these is intelligence.
The good hunter will show a long neck,
withers standing well back, and forelegs well forward
of the girth. He should have sloping shoulders and
great depth of chest. In fact, his chest should be so
deep that when you look at him his legs should not
appear as long as they are. He should have strong
quarters, and there is no valid objection to their
being “ragged,” for he needs great power in his
quarters to carry him over the jumps. Of course,
one may recall many instances of light-weight thoroughbreds
of beautiful conformation who are admirable
hunters, but they cannot be hunted every
day over a heavy country. That a hunter is to be
ridden by a woman, is no reason why his appearance
should be ladylike. The extra weight of a
side-saddle and the unevenness of the distribution
of the rider’s weight on his back, make it necessary
that a woman’s hunter should be quite as large
and powerful as a man’s. The recognized type of
hunter is close to the thoroughbred and quite distinct
from the harness horse. Without exception,
all hunters have more or less thoroughbred blood,
though sometimes we have to go unexpectedly far
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_168" id="Page_168" title="168"> </a><!--184.png-->
back to find it. Many of them are three-quarter
bred, and some have as little as one-quarter, or even
an eighth or a sixteenth. As for their blood, there
is no recognized standard of breeding. Some of the
best jumpers have come from trotting stock, some
from hackney stock, and some even have appeared,
as it were, by accident in stock of no recognized
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_169" id="Page_169" title="169"> </a><!--185.png-->
breeding at all, and the qualities that go to make a
hunter cannot be found with any certainty through
breeding. The principal qualification of a hunter is
that he should jump, and jumping is something that
seems to be born in individual horses, and to depend
not so much on their breeding as upon the union of
courage with a certain conformation.</p>

<p>The correct type for a park hack is the subject
of much diversity of opinion in the show ring as well
as in park riding. Some judges favor the thoroughbred
type, while some go to the other extreme and
favor the harness type. My choice for a park hack
is a sort of a “betwixt-and-between”; a riding horse
“smarter” and more “peacocky” than either the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_171" id="Page_171" title="171"> </a><!--187.png-->
thoroughbred or the Southern bred saddle horse; not
necessarily bristling with quality, yet showing plenty
of breeding, and with substance, style, and a snappy
all-round way of going. In other words, a horse that
fills the eye of the layman by his general showiness,
and yet satisfies his rider by the niceness of his
gaits and manners and the feeling of pride on being
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_172" id="Page_172" title="172"> </a><!--188.png-->
mounted on something that compels universal admiration.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="small-caps">Combination Type (Mayo)</span></div>
</div>

<p>Of late the term “road hack” has come into use.
This title does not yet denote a definite type. If I
were attempting to define it I should say a horse
more like the English cob, low in stature, not over
15.1, but great in substance, and with beauty somewhat
sacrificed to utility. He must be well mannered,
be as willing to stand as he is willing to go,
and should have a fast, well-balanced trot, as the
hardness of the roads often makes cantering impossible
on the highway. He should resemble the park
hack, but should be of a more useful and heavier
type, and if he can jump a bit, so much the better.</p>

<p>In all horse shows there is now a class for what is
called the “combination horse,” a type, as I have
heard some people say, that cannot exist without
detriment to either the riding or driving qualities of
the animal. With this I personally do not agree.
I think all saddle horses should be broken to drive,
for there are many occasions when they will be more
useful to their owners in harness than under saddle,
and it is far better when one cannot ride to exercise
one’s saddle horse by driving it to a light trap than
to have it ridden by a groom or a stranger. In this
country it is almost impossible to find a groom with
“hands,” and one’s own saddle horse should be kept
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_173" id="Page_173" title="173"> </a><!--189.png-->
for one’s own riding exclusively. Moreover, if one
has “hands,” one has them quite as much in driving
as in riding, and the horse will always feel that
he is under his mistress’s own control. Of course
one would never think of taking a schooled and
beautifully gaited saddle horse and making him
into a harness drudge, but occasional light work
in the shafts will do one’s horse far more good than
harm. While every saddle horse should go well in
harness, it does not follow that every harness horse
should go well under saddle, for the recognized type
of harness horse is utterly unsuited to the saddle. It
is not a question of training; no amount of training
could make the stiff-necked, flat-withered, heavy-shouldered
harness type into a saddle horse. He has
been bred for generations for dragging and not for
carrying, and he is an entirely distinct type from the
saddle horse.</p>

<p>So we find that the combination horse ought to
be rather a saddle horse that can be driven than a
harness horse that can be ridden, and, for the show
ring, the ideal combination horse is really a park
hack well broken to harness.</p>

<p>A good polo pony is a treasure in any stable.
For a country hack he is excellent, giving a good
ride, never tiring you, and never being tired himself.
His early training makes him unusually quick to
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_174" id="Page_174" title="174"> </a><!--190.png-->
rein and very bridle-wise. Once get used to his
quickness and you are sure to enjoy him.</p>

<img src="images/illus-175.jpg" class="photograph" width="500" height="457" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="small-caps">Show Pony</span></div>
</div>

<p>The type of polo pony has changed in the last ten
years, as the game is so much faster than it was.
Formerly the limit of height was fourteen hands.
Now it is 14.3. The type used to be a stocky,
rather heavily built pony, more of the type of an
English cob with a docked tail, such as we see in the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_175" id="Page_175" title="175"> </a><!--191.png-->
early polo prints. Now they have a great deal of
thoroughbred blood and many of them are three-quarter
bred, and have, of course, the characteristics
of that type. Many ponies which are too hot-blooded
for use in the polo field, or who are “mallet shy,”
make ideal riding hacks and are easily broken to
harness. Such ponies can often be picked up at
great bargains and made as useful a pony as one
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_176" id="Page_176" title="176"> </a><!--192.png-->
can well have at any price. In these days women
are beginning to play polo, and it goes without saying
that there is no difference in the type of polo
pony for a woman’s use from that for a man’s.</p>

<p>There is an exceptionally good type of pony
which has not appeared to any extent in this country,
commonly known as the Irish pony. This is a
cross between a thoroughbred and a half-bred hackney,
the small size being gained, of course, through
the hackney cross with the pony. They have much
of the fineness of the thoroughbred and a great deal
of the substance of the hackney. They have tremendous
endurance, are remarkably good combination
horses, can often jump a bit, and can be ridden
and driven all day long by any lady, and very often
are so gentle that a child can ride them. As
a combination pony they cannot be excelled, and
they are particularly useful to help out in a small
stable, as they can be used for station work and for
taking the children to the beach, and all that sort of
thing. They are, however, very high-priced and
hard to pick up at a bargain.</p>

<p>The safest and most reliable pony, from my experience,
for a child to begin on is an old polo pony
which has been ridden for some time by a woman
and has not had the excitement of the polo field for
many a year. If one wants, however, a smaller pony
<a name="Page_177" id="Page_177"> </a><!--193.png [full-page illo]-->
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_178" id="Page_178" title="178"> </a><!--194.png-->
than this for a child, the best type to my mind is the
Welsh pony. They are far more gentle and better
for children’s use than the Shetland pony, and are
much more reliable. I consider the kind of Shetland
pony that one finds in this country a treacherous
and stubborn little beast. Of course a pure-bred
Shetland pony which has been properly broken is
ideal for a child both to ride and to drive, but the
pure-bred ones are kept on the other side. It is
almost impossible to find them in this country and
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_179" id="Page_179" title="179"> </a><!--195.png-->
very few of them are bred here. My experience with
them is that they are not safe for children to ride or
drive. Of course, they are so small that if they have
a good load behind them and a reliable man to drive
them, they cannot do much harm, and they certainly
have great capacity for work. They live to a great
age and require but little care.</p>

THE SELECTION OF A SADDLE HORSE</h3>


<p><span class="upper">Having</span> decided on the type of horse that one
wants, the next thing is where to find him.
One of the most important points to bear in
mind, and one often overlooked in selecting a saddle
horse, is not only that he can be but that he should
be becoming to the rider, and this becomingness
depends largely upon the horse and rider being in
proper proportion to each other. It is better that
the horse should be too large and too heavy rather
than too small and too light. For instance, while a
tall woman looks out of proportion on a small horse
and a stout woman ridiculous, a small woman can
look smart on a large horse and a woman who weighs
little may look well on a weight carrier. Still, other
things being equal, I would advise that the choice be
given to a horse proportioned to the rider’s size and
weight.</p>

</div>

<p>Not only the horses themselves but the horse
buyers may be divided into classes. There is the
green purchaser with plenty of money and the green
one with only a hundred or two to spend; the clever
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_181" id="Page_181" title="181"> </a><!--197.png-->
buyer who “has an eye” and the buyer who thinks
she “has an eye.” The first mentioned should go
to a high-class dealer, rely on his advice, and thus
be sure of getting what she wants as long as she is
willing to pay the price. The second ought to find
something in the “practically sound ones” or among
the discarded polo ponies. The clever buyer will
fill her wants anywhere, in the auction marts, on the
stock farms, at the race track, or through a casual
meeting on the road, while the one who thinks she
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_182" id="Page_182" title="182"> </a><!--198.png-->
“has an eye” is a source of profit to others if not to
herself.</p>

<p>The attitude of the public at large toward the
horse dealer is to my thinking most unfair, for reputable
business methods are to be found among them
quite as much as in any other business or profession.
If the buyer’s experience is limited, there is nothing
in which she can be so easily deceived as in a horse.
Therefore, I strongly advise the novice to go always
to a dealer of good standing, state frankly what she
is looking for, how much she is willing to pay, and
put herself in his hands without affecting knowledge
which she lacks. When you go to a dealer of standing
you may be confident that having acquired a high
reputation he will maintain it, and will not sell you
a horse other than he represents it. If you go to a
“gyp” dealer you must keep your eyes open and rely
on a veterinary of your own selection, coupled with
the advice of some friend who has real knowledge of
horses; otherwise you are putting yourself at the
mercy of the kind of man who has given horse-dealers
at large the unfair reputation in which they are held
by the public.</p>

<p>Certainly the novice should not expect to get
“something for nothing,” and I would strongly advise
the buyer to make up her mind that it is better
economy in the long run to pay a good price for
<a name="Page_183" id="Page_183"> </a><!--199.png [full-page illo]-->
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_184" id="Page_184" title="184"> </a><!--200.png-->
what she wants than to buy something cheap and in
a short time have to sell it for even less than she may
have paid.</p>

<p>With regard to the prices charged by reputable
dealers, one must bear in mind the value of a horse’s
education, all the chances of sickness and of the development
of unsoundness which the dealer has had
to take, the great expense of a dealer’s establishment
in a large city, and the many hands through
which a horse has probably passed before he has
come into the dealer’s possession. There is not only
the first cost of the horse but also the expense of shipping
him from the country&mdash;where he was raised&mdash;into
the city; the cost of keeping him there until he
is conditioned and has passed through the dangers of
acclimatization&mdash;that is, sickness caused by change of
climate, of water, etc.&mdash;the risk of breaking him to
unaccustomed sights, and the long period of training
and developing into a schooled and mannered saddle
horse.</p>

</div>

<p>Once the type has been decided on, whether it
is a riding horse, a driving horse, or a combination
horse, the buyer must next determine whether she
knows enough to be able to trust to her own judgment,
and, if not, whether she knows some one who
has sufficient knowledge to be able to advise her
or whether she must rely entirely upon the dealer.
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_185" id="Page_185" title="185"> </a><!--201.png-->
She must, of course, be sure that any one on whose
advice she relies not only has sufficient knowledge but
is entirely disinterested. If you decide to rely on a
dealer, it is far the best way to pick out your dealer,
go to him, and then, if he has not just what you want,
ask him to get it for you instead of going yourself to
other dealers. This not only saves time, but the
dealer has a very much wider choice than you could
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_186" id="Page_186" title="186"> </a><!--202.png-->
possibly have yourself, and it is my experience that
by this method you will not have to pay any more
than you would if you went straight to the dealer
who has the animal that you want.</p>

<p>In buying a high-priced horse I would be sure
that he carried out all the conditions demanded by
his type: that he possessed beauty and good conformation,
that he was free from blemish, that his
manners were perfect, his disposition good, and his
age not less than five nor more than eight. A horse
younger than five is little more than a colt and more
liable to injury and blemish than an aged horse,
and eight years is a good boundary age, not only
from a point of usefulness, but as a matter of investment
as well. There is a popular prejudice against
paying a big price for an aged horse (“aged” being
the term applied to a horse after his eighth year);
that is, unless he is a show animal with a list of
winnings to his credit and bought to be shown.</p>

<p>A horse to have good conformation should show
a niceness of proportion in all his parts. Conformation
in a saddle horse calls for a nice head, and a long,
flexible, and crested neck&mdash;never a ewe-neck. Looking
from the withers downward he should present a
narrow appearance, for sharp, well-defined withers
are most necessary for the proper carrying of a side-saddle,
while gradually sloping shoulders hold the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_187" id="Page_187" title="187"> </a><!--203.png-->
saddle in place and go with good gaits and general
handiness and quickness. The back should be in
proportion to the rest of the horse, and short rather
than long. A very long back is usually a sign of
weakness and mars the general appearance, but
nearly as bad is the back that is too short. This is
generally accompanied by a very round barrel, flat
withers, thick shoulders, and a general undesirable
chunkiness. The sway-back and the roach-back must
also be rejected. The former makes the proper
adjustment of the saddle difficult and gives an awkward
“dipping back feeling” to the rider, especially
when posting. The roach-back is the other extreme
and makes her feel as if she were dipping forward.
The barrel should be well ribbed and the quarters
must not slope nor the tail be set too low or the top
line will be destroyed.</p>

<p>“Manners” in a horse mean perfection of training,
fearlessness, and a will subservient to that of the
rider, but do not mean a broken spirit. The spirit
should be there, but it should be under control.</p>

<p>When you have found a horse that “pleases your
eye,” have him shown to you at a walk, trot, and
canter, which will give you an opportunity of studying
his appearance in motion and his manners generally.
While at his gaits look at him from in front and
from behind as well as from the side; that is, have
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_188" id="Page_188" title="188"> </a><!--204.png-->
him ridden toward you and away from you as well
as past you at all his gaits. Have him change from
the walk to the canter and see how quickly and readily
he changes. Have him stand for a few minutes
and have him backed for at least six steps, and then
have him ridden a short distance at a fast canter
and see how easily he reins down. Mount him yourself
two or three times. A horse that will not stand
quietly and that fusses while you mount and dismount
is a nuisance; backing is a good test for
rearing, and reining in quickly is usually a sign
of a light mouth.</p>

<p>Never buy a puller; they are ruination to hands,
pleasure, and temper; so see that the horse you are
looking at is bitted lightly, that he wears the
ordinary double bridle with curb bit and bridoon,
and that the curb chain is not fastened too tight.
Beware of animals that are shown to you with tight
nosebands and tight curb chains, spoon bits, gag
snaffles, etc.,&mdash;these are signs of “pullers.” Equally
bad is the horse with no mouth at all, for he is
often a rearer or a jibber. I like to see a horse
trained to be ridden with an even pressure on both
curb and snaffle, as described in the chapter on
hands.</p>

<p>While the horse is being ridden for you to look
at, watch closely how he handles himself; see that his
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_189" id="Page_189" title="189"> </a><!--205.png-->
walk is free, his trot bold and well balanced, and his
action true all-round. By this I mean that his hock
action must be in keeping with his front action. A
high-stepping horse will give you a good ride if he
uses his hocks equally well, but a horse that is high-going
in front and stiff and draggy in the hocks is
impossible.</p>

<p>See that he neither “dishes out” nor “paddles,”
and that he does not travel so closely that there is
danger of his crossing his legs. Avoid the horse that
stretches too far in front and “points” or “dwells,”
for, except to a very good rider, these variations of
the gait are uncomfortable. They also count against
a horse in the show ring.</p>

<p>His training and the trueness of his way of going
having been proved, he must next be tried for courage.
If in the city, have him ridden past automobiles,
trolley cars, steam drills, and elevated roads;
if in the country, past automobiles, railroad trains,
mowing machines, steam rollers, or any unusual or
noisy object, and in both city and country see that
he minds strange sounds, such as automobile horns,
steam whistles, etc., no more than strange sights.</p>

<p>The trial having gone satisfactorily thus far,
have him saddled with your own saddle and before
mounting, ask the owner for points on the best way
of riding him.</p>
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_190" id="Page_190" title="190"> </a><!--206.png-->

<p>Different horses have different little peculiarities,
and may have been taught by various signals. The
person who has had experience with that particular
animal can give you valuable hints as to his training
and the signals for changing gaits, etc., to which he
is accustomed.</p>

<p>The horse being now ready for you, mount him
and start him off quietly; first walk him, then try
his trot and his canter, and if the gaits prove pleasant
the next step is the “vetting.”</p>

<p>Stallions, even the most tractable of them, are
not suitable for women either to ride or drive. The
choice of a horse should therefore be confined to
mares and geldings. There are many who consider
the gelding preferable to the mare, but with
this I do not quite agree. The mare has a peculiar
lightness of foot, vivacity, and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">élan</i> which are seldom
if ever found in the gelding.</p>

FORM</h3>


<p><span class="upper">Before</span> stepping into the trap, the horsewoman
should make it a habit to inspect the horse,
harness, and trap, and see that everything is as it
should be: that the horse is properly put to, that the
bit is right, that the girths are neither too tight nor
too loose, that the traces are neither too long nor
too short, and if there is a stop on the shaft that it is
just back of the tug. Be sure also that the trap is
properly turned out, that the rubbers are in, that
there is no accumulation of dust, that the nuts on
the wheels are tight, and that every detail has been
properly attended to. Not only is this a wise precaution
to use with hired traps, but it shows your
own coachman that you know what you are about,
and it keeps him up to his work. Having made
this inspection, which ought really to be done at a
glance,&mdash;except that a careful examination should
always be made of the horse’s head to be sure that
the curb chain is neither too loose nor too tight, the
bit not too far up nor too far down, and the mouthpiece
the width of the horse’s mouth&mdash;neither too
wide nor too narrow&mdash;and that the check or bearing
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_194" id="Page_194" title="194"> </a><!--210.png-->
rein, if one is used, is not too tight,&mdash;the next thing
is to step into the trap. If you are driving a lady’s
trap, such as a George IV, a Peters’, or a basket phaeton,
the groom who has driven the trap up from the
stable should, before getting out, have left the reins
across the middle of the dash with the end of the
reins on the seat, and the whip to the left of the
reins, leaning against the seat and pointing to the
rear. The groom should then stand at the horse’s
head. You should step into the trap with the left
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_195" id="Page_195" title="195"> </a><!--211.png-->
foot, putting the right foot on the step, then sit
down, and at the same time gather the reins in the
left hand and the whip in the right.</p>

</div>

<p>If you are driving a runabout or a cart, or any
other than a distinctly lady’s trap, the groom should
leave the whip in the socket and should pass the
reins doubled through the off terret of the pad from
rear to front in such a way that the buckle end
of the reins will hang even with the loop. You
should go to the off-side of the horse and draw the
reins through the terret with the left hand; then
take the reins in the right hand, the near rein
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_196" id="Page_196" title="196"> </a><!--212.png-->
under the forefinger and the off rein under the
third finger, with the ends coming out between the
thumb and forefinger. Then you take the reins just
beyond the right hand in the left, the near rein
between the thumb and forefinger and the off rein
between the second and third fingers, the ends passing
down the palm of the hand and out by the little
finger. Then step back until you are opposite the
dash, letting the reins slip through both hands, and
then, with the right hand, pull them through the
left a little more until they are at the length which
they will be when you are in the seat, and very
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_197" id="Page_197" title="197"> </a><!--213.png-->
lightly feel the horse’s mouth. Then take the whip
out of the socket with the right hand and transfer
the reins to the right hand in the same position as I
have described above, and step into the trap. Take
hold of the dash with the right hand, and put the
right foot on the step and step into the trap with
the left foot, and if necessary assist yourself by
placing the left hand on the seat when you are in
the act of stepping in. Sit down on the driving
seat and take the reins in the left hand in the position
described above, keeping the whip in the right
hand. So far, exactly the same things are done
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_198" id="Page_198" title="198"> </a><!--214.png-->
whether you are driving a pair or a single horse.
With a pair you should not have the whip laid across
the horses’ backs, as you would in driving four.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="small-caps">Stepping into the Trap</span></div>

<p>For ladies’ traps I prefer the square, almost level
driving cushion to the slanting one, as it is more
comfortable and gives a woman a more distinctive
appearance. For country traps, and particularly for
high carts, a slanting cushion may be more suitable.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="small-caps">“Orthodox” Position of Reins and Whip</span></div>
</div>

<p>When driving, it is most important that a woman
should sit correctly. She should hold herself erect,
without stiffness; her feet should be together and
her knees slightly bent. She should neither sit with
her knees straight nor, what is worse, be perched on
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_199" id="Page_199" title="199"> </a><!--215.png-->
the edge of the seat with her feet back; she should
never while driving loll against the back of the seat,
and she should look as though she were driving and
not as if she were being driven.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="illus-199">
<img src="images/illus-199.jpg" width="400" height="326" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="small-caps">“Modern” Position of Reins with Loop</span></div>
</div>

<p>There are only two correct ways to hold the reins
when driving, and so many people hold them incorrectly
that I will describe them in detail. The two
reins should always be held in the left hand, the
near rein between the thumb and forefinger, the off
rein between the second and third fingers, and the
ends passing down and out by the little finger. The
reins should be gripped by the fingers holding the
edges of the reins against the cushion of the hand,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_200" id="Page_200" title="200"> </a><!--216.png-->
and should not be held by squeezing the flat surfaces
of the reins between the fingers, and they should
be held tightly enough so that they will not slip, but
not so tightly as to cramp and tire the fingers. Holding
the reins in this way, well down into the fingers
and as close to the knuckles as possible, insures a
firm grip and makes it easy to guide to the right
or the left by merely turning the back of the hand
down or up. The left upper arm should be vertical,
the left forearm horizontal, the hand turned in at the
wrist, and held about six or eight inches in front of
the body. The right hand should be held in a corresponding
position about four or five inches from
the left hand.</p>

<p>The whip should be balanced in the palm of the
right hand, passing between the thumb and forefinger
so as to leave all the fingers free to grasp the
reins if need be. It should be carried at an angle
of forty-five degrees, and point toward the left and
front. The lash of the whip, for single and pair
horse driving, should always be free.</p>

<p>The theory of correct driving is that the left
hand is to hold the reins, the right hand to hold the
whip and to assist the left hand in shortening the
reins and in turning and stopping. The method of
holding the reins in the left hand, and keeping the
right hand only to assist the left, as I have described,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_201" id="Page_201" title="201"> </a><!--217.png-->
is that laid down by nearly all the recognized authorities
on driving,<a name="Marker_1" id="Marker_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="marker" title="Go to footnote 1">[1]</a> and for convenience I will call it
the orthodox method.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="illus-201">
<img src="images/illus-201.jpg" width="400" height="298" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="small-caps">Correct Position for Shortening Reins</span></div>
</div>

<p>A variation on this method has, however, been
introduced recently, and is now generally adopted
by many of the best whips, both in England and
this country, and is almost universally used in the
show ring, where it is considered the correct form.
For convenience I shall refer to this as the modern
method. In this method, while the reins are held
in the left hand as I have described, the off rein is
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_202" id="Page_202" title="202"> </a><!--218.png-->
allowed to slip through the second and third fingers
about five or six inches, and is held in the right
hand, passing under the little finger and coming out
between the first and second fingers. The right hand
is held about three or four inches from the left and
symmetrically to it; the portion of the reins between
the right and left hand is slightly loose. The whip
is held in the right hand exactly as I have described,
so that the forefinger of the right hand is extended
and the other three fingers closed on the rein, the
third finger and little finger holding it tightly and
the second finger loosely. The reins are habitually
held in this way, and the horse is guided to the
right by pulling with the right hand on the off rein,
and is guided to the left by turning the back of the
left hand up and, if necessary, moving the right
hand slightly forward and the left hand slightly back,
so as to loosen the off rein and tighten the near rein.
If, however, when driving in this way any occasion
arises for using the whip, the off rein must be first
shortened in the left hand by pushing it through the
second and third fingers from the front with the
right hand. The right hand then lets go of the off
rein and the whip is used as I have described. This
method of driving is now taught by the best professionals.
It looks smarter than the other method,
and when the reins are held in this way the horse
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_203" id="Page_203" title="203"> </a><!--219.png-->
is under better control, and can be turned more
quickly and at a proper angle, and with less apparent
movement of the hand, and with well-trained and
properly bitted horses it is probably the best method
to adopt. But with green or ill-trained horses it is
not an advisable method, because it takes a little
longer to shorten the reins than the orthodox
method, where the right hand is free and can immediately
be placed in front of the left. Whether
both hands are on the reins or not, the reins should
always measure the same length and should never
be allowed to slip through the fingers. The horse’s
head should always be kept straight, and to do this
the hands must be held level.</p>

<p>The whip must always be held in the right hand;
the horse must never be touched with the whip
while the right hand is on the reins. The whip
should be used sparingly, and it is much more likely
to be too much used than too little. It is used more
in driving a pair than in driving a single horse, as
one horse often lags behind the other and it may be
necessary to use it on him to keep him up, though
this should be done rather by proper bitting than
by the use of the whip. Before using a whip, however,
for punishment, be sure you hold the reins
firmly in the left hand and that the horse is well
gathered, otherwise he will start forward when you
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_204" id="Page_204" title="204"> </a><!--220.png-->
whip him and may get away from you. In fact, it
is most important always to gather the reins well
in the left hand before even touching your horse
with the whip, as otherwise you will have the horse
going in a series of jumps, which is not only very
bad form but uncomfortable for every one in the trap.</p>

<p>I cannot insist too strongly on the necessity of
having both reins securely held in the left hand and
the horse well gathered before using the whip, for
if you touch the horse with the whip with the off
rein in the right hand, you are sure to slacken that
rein and thus cause the horse to turn to the left.
Moreover, if the horse starts, you are not in a position
to control him.</p>

<p>To pull horses up and to stop them, you must first
see that the reins are held evenly in the left hand;
then place the right hand as far in front of the left
as may be necessary. If you know that the horse
has a hard mouth and does not stop readily, the right
hand must be a foot or even more in front of the
left, while with a horse that is light mouthed and
stops quickly it should be only a few inches. The
right hand is placed over both reins&mdash;some separate
the reins by the third and little fingers, others put
the little finger on top of both reins&mdash;and the left
hand is raised and carried forward, at the same time
the right hand is brought back so as to bring the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_205" id="Page_205" title="205"> </a><!--221.png-->
left hand above and directly over the right. The
horse should not, of course, be reined in with any
sudden jerk, but only by a gentle and gradually
increasing pressure, which is accomplished much
more easily by this method of laying the right hand
on the reins than it could be by pulling the reins
with the arms or body.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="illus-205">
<img src="images/illus-205.jpg" class="photograph" width="500" height="314" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="small-caps">Pulling Up</span></div>
</div>

<p>Nothing looks worse or is such bad form, in
stopping horses, as to pull the reins in toward the
body, as is so often done by those who do not understand
driving. Not only does this look badly, but
it is dangerous, for it leaves the driver with no control
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_206" id="Page_206" title="206"> </a><!--222.png-->
whatever over the horses as soon as her hands
come up to her body. There is no way by which she
can take up any more slack except by leaning so far
back that she looks as if she were falling over backward.
In the correct method of stopping, which I
have described, if not enough slack has been taken
up at first, more can be taken by simply slipping
the right hand further along the reins and carrying
the left hand higher and more to the front, and
throughout the whole operation the two hands should
not be carried further to the rear than they were
when you began. While this is, and always has been,
the correct method of pulling up, it is astonishing
how few remember to use it, even in classes in the
show ring, where driving counts. Another great
advantage of this method is that it is very similar to
that used in pulling up a tandem or a four, and
it is best to acquire the habit of correct driving for
a single horse and for a pair, which will not have to
be altered when you take up driving four-in-hand
and tandem.</p>

<p>If you wish to turn to the left, when driving
with what I have called the orthodox method, you
should take the near rein in the right hand between
the second and third fingers a few inches in front
of the left hand and pull gently with the right
hand, keeping the left hand as it was or advancing
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_207" id="Page_207" title="207"> </a><!--223.png-->
it slightly so as to loosen the off rein; then, as the
horse is completing the turn, gradually relax the
hold with the right hand, and when the turn is finished
let go with the right hand.</p>

<p>In turning to the right the off rein should be
gathered in the right hand under the little finger, a
few inches in front of the left, and the horse pulled
to the right by the right hand similarly to the way
I have described for turning to the left.</p>

<p>In both the “orthodox” and “modern” methods,
to shorten the reins in order to keep horses under
better control or to slow them down, the reins
must first be evenly held in the left hand; then the
right hand is placed in front of the left, the off
rein under the little finger, the near rein between
the first and second fingers, and the reins are then
grasped firmly in the right hand and drawn back
and pushed through the left hand. It is bad form,
in shortening the reins, to take the reins behind
the left hand and pull them through with the right,
though through carelessness many do it. If there
is occasion to shorten the reins more than a few
inches, instead of pushing through, let go with the
left hand and again grasp the reins with the left
hand in front of the right, and then, if necessary,
continue to pull in hand over hand.</p>

<p>If in the act of turning a corner, or making any
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_208" id="Page_208" title="208"> </a><!--224.png-->
turn, there should be occasion to use the whip, as
sometimes happens, particularly in pair driving, a
“point” may be taken on the rein on the side toward
which the turn is being made: thus, if turning to the
left, take the near rein in the right hand between
the first and second fingers and loosen the hold of
the left thumb on the near rein for a moment, carry
the right hand up to the left hand, and then place
the thumb on the rein so as to form a loop, then let
go with the right hand. This leaves the right hand
free to use the whip, and holds the near rein sufficiently
to keep the horse turning. If there is too
much pressure, relax the left thumb and let the
loop slip a little. Similarly, in turning to the right,
grasp the off rein under the little finger of the right
hand and push it back, letting it slip between the
second and third fingers of the left hand until a loop
is formed to the rear of the fingers, then close the
left thumb on this loop and let go with the right
hand, which is then free as before. This loop, if too
much rein has been taken up, can be allowed to slip
through the fingers of the left hand as much as may
be necessary. In making a turn it is not under
any circumstances advisable to use the whip while
either rein is in the right hand; it is much better not
to use the whip until the turn is completed.</p>

<p>To lengthen the reins, do not let them slip through
<a name="Page_209" id="Page_209"> </a><!--225.png [full-page illo]-->
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_210" id="Page_210" title="210"> </a><!--226.png-->
the left hand, but take them in the right hand, the
off rein under the little finger, and the near rein
between the second and third fingers immediately in
front of the left hand; then close the fingers of the
right hand on the reins, relax the fingers of the left
hand, and pull the reins through the left hand with
the right as far as may be necessary. Letting the
reins slip through the left hand without the assistance
of the right, as I described, is bad form, and is
unsafe, because they may not slip evenly and they
might well slip too much. Besides that, in driving
spirited horses it is most important to have an even
pressure on the bits and to feel their mouths all the
time. If the reins are allowed to go, even for a moment,
as they would be in letting them slip through
the left hand without the assistance of the right,
the horses would know it and be very apt to start
and even to run.</p>

<p>All that I have said above with regard to the
management of the reins, applies equally to the driving
of a pair or of a single horse. It does not apply
to the driving of roadsters or trotting horses, as they
are differently trained and driven in an entirely different
method.</p>

<p>In learning to drive, unless one is being taught
by a professional or other experienced whip, I would
rather advise beginning with the “orthodox” method,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_211" id="Page_211" title="211"> </a><!--227.png-->
and thus learning thoroughly the correct fundamental
principles of driving, which are the same in
both methods. The “modern” is simply a variation
on the “orthodox,” and the danger of beginning
with the “modern” method is that with the
off rein held in the right hand, as I have described
on <a href="#Page_199">page 199</a>, the beginner may fall into the very
incorrect, though common, method of holding a rein
in each hand, and so not have the right hand constantly
in readiness to assist the left in shortening
the reins, in pulling up, in turning, and in the use
of the whip.</p>

<p>The reins should never under any circumstances
be held separately, one in each hand, for, obviously,
if they are, the right hand cannot assist the left, the
whip cannot be used, the horses can only be pulled
up to the extent of the distance of the two hands
in front of the body, and it is impossible to keep an
even pressure on both reins; one hand will always
pull more than the other. Holding a rein in each
hand violates the first and fundamental principle of
correct driving&mdash;that the two reins must at all times
be held firmly in the left hand.</p>

<p>It is needless to add that the horse must never,
under any circumstances, be struck with the reins.</p>

<p>When starting, the horses should first be gathered
well in hand, and then, at the moment of starting,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_212" id="Page_212" title="212"> </a><!--228.png-->
given their heads by carrying the hands forward.
Many drivers make the mistake of trying to start
the horses by pulling them back instead of giving
them their heads.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="illus-212">
<img src="images/illus-212.jpg" class="photograph" width="500" height="314" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="small-caps">Starting</span></div>
</div>

<p>If you are driving in the afternoon, and there is
any chance of your being out after dark, you should
always be sure that the lamps are on the trap and
that they have new candles; also, in country driving,
be sure at all times that there are tools under the
seat, including a wrench, a hoof pick, and matches.</p>

<p>In using the whip never strike a horse in front
of the pad, or on his belly or legs, but always
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_213" id="Page_213" title="213"> </a><!--229.png-->
on his quarters, and do not use the whip unnecessarily
or keep up a constant tapping on the horse.
“Tapping” is a very bad habit, into which many
people fall, and it completely spoils a horse, as he
becomes so accustomed to the whip that it produces
no effect on him unless used with violence, which
should seldom, if ever, be necessary. If your horse
is lazy, instead of constantly tapping him, give him
one vigorous lash, and accompany it by a decisive
tone of the voice. A few repetitions of this will,
almost always, cure his laziness, and presently the
voice alone will be sufficient. “Tapping” will only
make the horse more confirmed in his laziness.</p>

<p>In driving, if your horse shies, you should never
whip him; you must keep control of him by a firm
hold of the reins, and if possible drive him quietly
up to the object that he is afraid of and make him
pass it, and if practicable make him pass it two or
three times until he has forgotten his fear. You
must have the right hand in readiness to pull hard
on the rein opposite to the side toward which he is
shying, so as to avoid his overturning the trap, which,
incidentally, is another demonstration of the importance
of using the correct method.</p>

<p>If your horse rears, give him his head immediately
by loosening the reins, and urge him forward
with voice or whip, or both if necessary. If he
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_214" id="Page_214" title="214"> </a><!--230.png-->
becomes uncontrollable and rears over backward,
spring out of the trap on the side opposite to that
on which his legs are, keeping a firm hold of the
reins, and, as quickly as you can, sit on his head.
Do not let him attempt to get up until he is clear
of the trap.</p>

<p>In driving, particularly with a single horse, the
greatest danger is from kicking, for once your horse
begins to kick you are in great danger in any kind
of a trap, except a breaking cart, where the distance
between the driver and the horse is so great
that he can kick freely without touching the body
of the cart. Of course no woman should knowingly
drive a kicking horse, and if there is any question
about it she should always take the precaution to
use a kicking strap. A kicking strap cannot, however,
be used in the show ring, but generally its use
on other occasions is advisable. A kicking strap,
fitting tightly when the horse is standing, of course
effectually prevents a horse from kicking, as he cannot
kick without first raising his quarters. The
kicking strap, to be of real service, must be very
strong. Bad accidents have happened through the
kicking strap breaking, and a horse in the act of
raising his quarters to kick has great power.</p>

<p>In driving green horses single, it is much safer
to use a high cart than any kind of a four-wheel
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_215" id="Page_215" title="215"> </a><!--231.png-->
trap. With a cart, the horse cannot, of course,
cramp the wheel, and in a high cart there is much
less danger from his kicking.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="illus-215">

<div class="caption"><span class="small-caps">Pulling Reins Through Terret after Pulling Up</span></div>
</div>

<p>To get out of a trap when you have no groom,
first lay the whip on the seat pointing toward the
back of the trap, then place the reins in the right
hand, taking them up enough to feel the horse’s
mouth. Grasp the dash with the right hand and
step out of the trap backward, with the right foot
on the step, the left foot coming first to the ground;
then step forward until opposite the pad and put
the reins through the off terret in the position described
on <a href="#Page_197">page 197</a>.</p>
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_216" id="Page_216" title="216"> </a><!--232.png-->

<p>When, however, a servant is in attendance, he
should, as soon as you pull up, stand at the horse’s
head; you then simply drop the reins with the left
hand so that they lie over the dash; either lay the
whip, as above described, to the left of the reins
pointing to the rear, or else place it in the socket;
then step out of the trap, facing forward, the left
foot on the step. The servant then steps into the
trap on the same side on which you have stepped
out.</p>

<p>If the horse will not stand, it is quite correct to
step out forward, keeping the reins in the left hand,
and then to hand them to the servant when you
have reached the ground, having first laid the whip
on the seat pointing to the rear.</p>

<p>If you are driving a phaeton with a servant on
the rumble, he should jump out as you begin to
pull up and run to the horse’s head. If, however,
your horse is very nervous and will not stand, it
is quite correct to have the servant stay on the
rumble, and then, after you have pulled up, to pass
the reins back to him on your left side. Then place
the whip in the socket and step out, facing forward.</p>

FOUR-IN-HAND AND TANDEM DRIVING</h3>


<p><span class="upper">As</span> this book is limited in its scope to riding and
driving for women, I shall not attempt to discuss
four-in-hand and tandem driving in detail, and
for a very exhaustive work on four-in-hand driving,
would refer the reader to “A Manual of Coaching,”
by Fairman Rogers (Philadelphia, J.&nbsp;B. Lippincott
Co., 1900), and to “Driving for Pleasure,” by Frank
Underhill (D. Appleton, 1897).</p>

<p>One of the best short books on the technique
of driving is “Hints on Driving,” by Captain C.
Morley-Knight, R.A. (George Bell &amp; Sons, London,
1895). Chapter VI of that book describes in detail
the method of holding and shortening the reins in
four-in-hand driving, and chapter X the same problem
in tandem driving. Like other English authorities,
he, however, gives quite a different position for
the right hand in tandem driving from that in four-in-hand
driving, while the chief American writers,
and nearly all the best whips of my acquaintance,
advocate and use substantially the same position of
the right hand in both.</p>

<p>Before beginning to drive either tandem or four-in-hand,
it is absolutely essential that you become
proficient in handling the whip, and I would strongly
advise learning to “catch a thong,” by daily practice,
either outside on the ground, or, better still,
on the box of the coach or driving seat of the cart,
of course without the horses. By so doing one can
concentrate one’s mind upon the thong without
being distracted with the management of the reins
and the movement of the horses. The best and
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_220" id="Page_220" title="220"> </a><!--236.png-->
clearest description which I have found in any work
is in chapter XX of “The Private Stable,” by
James A. Garland (Little, Brown &amp; Co., Boston,
1903), and in describing how to catch a double
thong I cannot do better than to quote what he
says on pages 546 and 547:</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="illus-220">
<img src="images/illus-220.jpg" width="600" height="237" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="small-caps">Four-in-Hand Harness</span></div>
</div>

<blockquote>
<p>“Hold the whip horizontally in front of you with
the end of the thong held between the handle of the
whip and your fingers. Face a wall or the side of a
building and with the quill end of the whip describe
a letter “S” backward. Begin with the lower tail
of the letter, following its form to the upper end.
Don’t move the arm, keep the elbow easily by the
side, and direct the movement of the whip by turning
the wrist. Continue to increase the speed until
the thong falls in place. At first a short downward
movement at the end will facilitate the accomplishment
of this somewhat difficult feat.</p>

<p>
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_221" id="Page_221" title="221"> </a><!--237.png-->
“Another method is to catch the thong over the
head instead of in front or to the side. This is done
virtually by the same movement, the imaginary letter
“S” being horizontally overhead instead of vertically
in front or to one side.</p>

<p>“Still another method involves a new movement.
Hold the whip with the right hand against the waist
and the quill end well around to the left and on a
line with the top of the head. Carry the stick at
this angle around to the right until in a line with
the right shoulder. In so doing raise the right hand
gradually. Now drop the quill end of the whip
until it is on a line with the handle. This last
movement should be executed quickly so that the
end of the stick strikes the thong on the right-hand
side of the stick.</p>

<p>“When the thong is caught, it is wound around
the stick in opposite directions. The lower end
should be unwound with the right hand, the whip
being held between the thumb and forefinger of the
left hand. The end of the thong should be rewound
in the same direction as the upper part and held in
place by the right hand. The loop should be about
two feet and a half long and caught on the quill
part of the stick.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not until you are proficient enough to catch
the thong with certainty should you attempt to
drive either four-in-hand or tandem, and you will
find, the moment that you take the reins in your
hands and start to drive, that it will be far more
difficult to catch the thong than when you could
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_222" id="Page_222" title="222"> </a><!--238.png-->
give it your undivided attention. Moreover, it is
vastly more difficult to catch the thong in a wind,
or under trees or other obstacles, than when learning
in the stable, and constant practice is required
to keep one’s hand in.</p>

<p>I shall not attempt to describe how the horses
should be put to a coach or a tandem, for to do
so would be to go far beyond the scope of this
book, so I shall assume that the coach or cart, as
the case may be, is correctly appointed and the
horses properly put to.</p>

<p>To quote further from Mr. Garland’s work:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“In taking up the reins stand about two feet
from the pad of the off wheeler. Remove the reins
from the pad terret or trace tug and allow them to
fall to the ground.</p>

<p>“First take up the near lead rein with the left
hand, placing the little, second, and middle fingers
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_224" id="Page_224" title="224"> </a><!--240.png-->
under the rein. Drop the left hand to the side, allowing
the reins to slip through the fingers. Tighten
the fingers over the rein at this point. Now raise
the left hand and place the little and second fingers
under the off lead rein. Drop the hand to the side
as before. The parts where the reins are joined
should hang evenly in front of the left hand. The
reins may be adjusted by taking the rein that is to
be drawn out between the middle and index fingers
of the right hand. The reins should now be transferred
into the right hand, separated by the middle
finger.</p>

<p>“Take up the wheel reins in the left hand, separating
them with the middle finger, the near wheel
rein on top. Drop the left hand to the side as described
in the preceding paragraph. Now raise the
hand and adjust the reins, with the thumb and forefinger
of the right hand, so that the buckles on the
wheel reins hang evenly.</p>

<p>“Pass the lead reins into the left hand, the near
rein over the index finger and the off lead rein under
the index finger and on top of the near wheel rein.</p>

<p>“When taking up the reins, draw each in turn
gently through the terrets, tight enough merely to
‘feel’ the bit without causing the horse to flex his
neck or make any backward movement.</p>

<p>“Step back to the wheelers’ hocks, and, keeping
the left hand against the body, take the reins with
the right hand in the same order as they are in the
left hand. With the right hand close in front of the
left one, draw the reins through the fingers of the
left hand as far as the right arm can be extended,
and then remove the right hand.</p>

<p>“As soon as this is done, take the whip in the
right hand from the foot-board (if a tandem), or from
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_225" id="Page_225" title="225"> </a><!--241.png-->
the backs of the wheelers (if a four-in-hand), and
transfer the reins into the right hand in the same
order as they were held in the left hand. The reins
are now to one side and out of your way in mounting.</p>

<p>“Place your left foot on the hub, your right on
the roller-bolt, then the left foot on the body step,
and the right one on the foot-board. Take your
seat as soon as possible and transfer the reins back
into the left hand in the original order.”</p>

<p>To start a four-in-hand, the horses should, before
starting, be well up in their collars, so that the
traces are taut. The leaders’ reins should be shortened
by grasping them in the right hand, separated
by the middle finger, about a foot in front of the
left hand and replacing them in the left by carrying
the right hand behind the left. Take off the brake
as quietly as possible, then advance the right hand,
put the little and second fingers over the two off
reins with the middle and index fingers so placed
over the two near reins that the latter may be
grasped. When you are sure that the four horses

are feeling the bit and they are well together, drop
and advance the hands, and at the same time give
the horses a signal; at the same moment the grooms
let go their heads, and the horses should all start
together. Once the horses are in motion together,
bring the left hand up into its position near the
centre of the waist, and, removing the right hand
from the reins, hold it slightly in advance of the
left. To quote again from Mr. Garland:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“To shorten or lengthen the lead reins, place the
middle finger of the right hand between the lead
reins directly or at some little distance in front of
the left hand, depending upon how much the lead
reins are to be taken up or lengthened. If you wish
to lengthen them, tighten the fingers of the right
hand and draw the reins out to the desired distance.
Should you wish to shorten the lead reins, take them
out of the left hand, and in putting them back
bring the left hand behind the right one. Do not
advance the left hand.</p>

<p>“To lengthen or shorten the wheel reins, place
the right hand under the lead reins and grasp the
wheel reins in the same manner as described for taking
up the lead reins. The wheel reins can now be
either pushed back or drawn through the fingers of
the left hand.</p>


<div class="title">“TO STRAIGHTEN THE TEAM</div>

<p>“Should the leaders work over to the right of the
wheelers, grasp the two reins, which are between the
second and middle fingers of the left hand, between
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_228" id="Page_228" title="228"> </a><!--244.png-->
the middle and index fingers of the right hand.
Draw these reins (the off lead and the near wheel)
out a little, and it will be seen that it has the effect
of bringing the team into line. Should the leaders
work over to the left of the wheelers, instead of
drawing the centre reins out, work them a little further
back through the fingers of the left hand.</p>


<div class="title">“STOPPING</div>

<p>“When it is desired to stop the team, raise the
left hand, and, placing the right hand over the reins,
twelve inches in front of the left hand, as described
in a preceding paragraph, press the reins in toward
the body with the right hand.</p>


<div class="title">“TURNING</div>

<p>“To turn to the right, shorten the leaders’ reins
so that the lead bars hang slack, and place the little,
second, and middle fingers over the off lead rein
about five inches in front of the left hand (depending
upon how sharp a turn you desire to make).
Draw the off lead rein back over the forefinger of
the left hand, first raising the left thumb. Whenever
you think you have shortened the rein sufficiently,
drop the thumb on the loop thus made.</p>

middle finger between the lead reins they may be
operated separately or together.</p>

back together at any time in making the turn. As
soon as the turn has been completed, lift the left
thumb and let out the loop of the off lead rein; then,
after giving the leaders more rein, let the hands

right hand and insert the middle finger between the
off and near wheel reins. The near wheeler may be
made to follow the near leader by tightening the
near wheel rein with the middle and forefingers.
Opposition may be exerted on each or both off reins,

grasping the near wheel rein with the little, second,

lead rein and back over the index finger of the left
hand, dropping the rein down in front of and around
the thumb, in such a manner that the rein will be
held in place by the fleshy part of the thumb near
the wrist. Now make a ten-inch loop with the off
lead rein, holding the loop in place with the thumb,
and, reaching under the lead reins, make, in a similar
manner, a point with the off wheel rein. After
the turn is made, first drop the points, then the
opposition over the thumb, and finally let out your
leaders.</p>

<p>“In turning an acute angle to the left, first take
up the leaders, then place the right hand under the
off lead rein, and push back toward the body the
off wheel rein through the fingers of the left hand,
and make the two points with the near lead and
wheel reins. After the turn has been made, draw
out the off wheel rein with the right hand until the
buckles on the hand pieces are even. Then let out
the off wheel rein and the two points as described
in preceding paragraph.</p>

<p>What has been said and quoted above relates more
particularly to four-in-hand driving, but the principles
of tandem driving are the same, except that it
must be borne in mind that to drive tandem requires
far lighter hands and more quickness and skill on the
part of the driver than it does to drive a four. There
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_233" id="Page_233" title="233"> </a><!--249.png-->
is, of course, nothing to steady the tandem leader
and, in cases where in driving a four-in-hand it would
be necessary to make and hold a point&mdash;as, for instance,
in turning a corner&mdash;with a tandem it will
often only be necessary to touch the leader’s rein.
Remember, also, that the wheeler is only too apt to
turn the moment he sees the leader turn, and it is
often necessary to steady the wheeler by a pressure
on the opposition rein, and, if he has a hard mouth
or a sluggish one, it may even be necessary to make
an opposition point to prevent him from making too
sharp a turn. Except for the fact that a four-in-hand
requires far more strength, tandem is the more
difficult of the two. It is, however, peculiarly well
suited for a woman because of her light hands and
quickness, and there is no reason why women should
not excel in this form of driving. Indeed, in the
show ring, there have been far fewer accidents with
women driving tandem than with men.</p>

<p>As most of the current works on four-in-hand and
tandem driving were written before the days of automobiles,
added caution is now needed, particularly
with respect to the tandem. No woman should, under
any circumstances, attempt to drive horses tandem unless
they are thoroughly accustomed to automobiles,
and it is necessary nowadays to be very much more on
the alert than it was before the evil days of gasolene.</p>

</div>

<p>While with a well-trained tandem there will seldom
be occasion for much whip work, at the same
time, even with the best-trained horses, there will
be occasions when the leader can only be controlled
by the prompt and skilful use of the whip. With
green horses it is quite impossible to control the
leader without being prepared to use the whip at
any moment. The ability to catch the thong comes
into play far more frequently with a tandem than
with a four-in-hand, and it is even more essential
with a tandem, for the thong is more easily caught
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_235" id="Page_235" title="235"> </a><!--251.png-->
in the wheels of a cart, and particularly of a gig, than
a coach.</p>

<p>With regard to the kind of cart to which the
tandem should be driven, it is to be noted that, for
several years past in the show ring, tandems have
been generally shown to gigs, and very few tandems
have been shown to carts even in country shows. This
may result in giving the general impression that the
gig is the correct vehicle to which to drive a tandem,
which is far from being the case. No recognized
authority holds that it is the correct vehicle,
and, for road driving, a gig is thoroughly unsuited
to a tandem. While a gig is more comfortable and
balances better than a wrongly adjusted tandem
cart, yet a gig is much too low for the driver either
to have proper control of his leader or to be able to
see obstacles in front of the leader. Moreover, a gig,
having a much smaller body than a tandem cart and
also short shafts, gives an appearance of wrong proportion
to the tandem, and, especially from a distance,
an effect of something lacking. This is particularly
the case with horses over fifteen hands two.
If a gig is used, it is important that the lead traces
should be as short as possible, so as to make the
whole appearance more compact.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="illus-236">
<img src="images/illus-236.jpg" width="600" height="257" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="small-caps">Correct Tandem Harness for Show Ring</span></div>
</div>

<p>For road work, and particularly for country driving,
a tandem cart is not only correct, but is a more
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_236" id="Page_236" title="236"> </a><!--252.png-->
practical and suitable vehicle than a gig, particularly
with large horses. The driver is well up above
the horses, which gives far better control; she is
able to see well ahead of the leader, and there is also
the advantage of being out of the dust and in a position
where one can better see other vehicles, both
in meeting and passing them. Whatever kind of
vehicle is used, the tugs should be so adjusted that
the vehicle is in balance when the shafts are in position.
While this is not so important with a gig
or a cart whose body is hung on springs independent
of the shafts, it is absolutely essential with a tandem
cart, or any other cart, where the body is not balanced
independently. I wish to lay great emphasis
on this point because very few grooms know anything
about it, and it is the most common thing in the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_237" id="Page_237" title="237"> </a><!--253.png-->
world to find a horse put to a cart with the girth
strapped so tightly that there is no play to the shafts.
This is entirely wrong. If English tugs are used, as
they should be with a tandem cart, the girth should
be so loose that the shafts not only play in the tug,
but the tug plays in the girth, and this will usually
be done by letting out the girth from four to five
holes beyond where it would be if it were tight.</p>

<p>With regard to balance, the body of a tandem
cart is made to slide on runners, and the position
of the body is regulated by a screw with a handle
which comes up under the driving cushion. This
handle may be turned so as to throw the body
backward or forward, according to the number of
persons who are to sit in the cart; thus, if a groom
is to sit on the back seat, the body of the cart
should naturally be much farther forward than if
the back seat were empty, and, for the same reason,
if there is the additional weight in front of another
person besides the driver, the body of the cart should
be moved farther back than if the driver were alone.
The proper position of the body of the cart&mdash;so that
it will be in balance&mdash;can only be learned by experiment,
for it varies, of course, with the angle of the
shafts and the weight of the load to be carried.</p>

<p>While the tandem cart is correct for tandem
driving under all circumstances, for country use
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_238" id="Page_238" title="238"> </a><!--254.png-->
there are several forms of light high carts which
are quite correct and much easier for the horses in
hilly country or on heavy roads. While the bodies
of these carts are not adjustable, balance can be
secured by raising or lowering the tugs in the girths
so as to raise or lower the shafts, and by adjusting
the position of the people in the cart. In all high
carts the weight should be thrown forward in going
uphill and back in going downhill. It is an interesting
fact that a horse can pull a heavier load
uphill the more weight, within reasonable limits, he
has on his back.</p>

<a class="pagenum" name="Page_239" id="Page_239" title="239"> </a><!--255.png-->

<p>In tandem driving, when going downhill, the
leader’s reins should be shortened; if the hill is long,
they should be grasped in the right hand a few
inches in front of the left, separated by the middle
finger, released from the left hand for a moment,
then carried back with the right hand behind the
left and grasped again in the left, and held there
until the bottom of the hill is reached. If, however,
the hill is only a short one, they may be simply
taken up in the right hand and held there for
a moment. The leader should, of course, not be
pulling at all when going downhill; on the other
hand, his traces should not be so loose as to give
him any chance of getting his feet over. In travelling
on the level, the leader’s traces should be only
moderately taut. The tendency with beginners is
to let the leader do too much work; this not only
tires the leader, but it gets the wheeler in the bad
habit of letting the leader pull not only the cart but
the wheeler as well, and, in general, the leader should
rather be reserved for uphill work. On the level
most of the work, and downhill all of it, should
be done by the wheeler.</p>

<p>While tandem driving originated in driving one’s
hunter in the lead to the meet so that there was no
attempt at having the horses match, nowadays
matched pairs are commonly shown in the ring
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_240" id="Page_240" title="240"> </a><!--256.png-->
tandem, so that it may be said that there are three
different classes of tandem horses: First, matched
pairs; second, a large wheeler with a small, showy
leader; and third, two horses of the hunter type,
not necessarily matched, for a sporting tandem and
for country work. It is a mistake to suppose that
tandems are merely ornamental; on the contrary, it
is one of the most practical ways of harnessing two
horses, and the only really practical way of harnessing
two horses to a cart. Horses generally enjoy
being driven tandem because it means freedom for
them both, and they can exert their strength to great
advantage. Indeed, on the Continent nearly all the
heavy trucking is done with very high two-wheeled
vehicles drawn by two, three, or even four horses
tandem.</p>

<p>Those who are in favor of putting a harness on
their hunter will find that one of the best ways of
exercising a hunter is by driving him in the lead of
a tandem, as there he may be given much less pulling
than if he is driven single. If you have a long-tailed
hunter, do not, however, drive him in the lead.
No long-tailed horse should ever be driven in the
lead of a tandem, save in the exceptional case of
showing a sporting tandem in the ring. The sporting
tandem, as shown in the ring, is made up of
any kind of a wheeler and the hunter in the lead
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_241" id="Page_241" title="241"> </a><!--257.png-->
with his saddle on. The riding bridle is carried in
the cart.</p>

<p>Of late years there has been a great outcry against
the practice of docking which, in my opinion, has
arisen through ignorance and prejudice, and has
been raised by people who do not at all realize the
dangers of driving long-tailed horses, especially in
a four or tandem.</p>

<p>The arguments used against docking are first that
it is cruel and second that it prevents a horse from
brushing off the flies. Neither of these objections
is well founded. The operation, when properly done
by a competent man, causes almost no pain to the
horse, is done very quickly, and has no after ill effects.
With regard to brushing off flies, this argument would
be quite good if horses were left out in the fields
without anything on them, but to use it with regard
to the driving horses of persons of means is perfectly
ridiculous. When a horse is harnessed he cannot
possibly use his tail to brush off the flies. When he
is standing in a properly appointed stable, he is
always covered in summer with a sheet and in winter
with a blanket, and there are no flies in winter. When
he is turned out in summer he is always covered with
a sheet.</p>

<p>Docking is not, as its opponents assert, a senseless
fashion, but is founded on reason. A long-tailed
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_242" id="Page_242" title="242"> </a><!--258.png-->
horse, particularly if driven in a low four-wheeled
trap, is almost sure, however careful the driver may
be, to get his tail over at least one of the reins. If
he does, it is a matter of great difficulty to release the
rein, and if the horse is high-spirited or in any way
vicious, as long as his tail is over the rein the driver
has absolutely no control over him. He is in a position
to kick, which he is almost sure to do, or to run,
or to do anything he pleases, and he nearly always
does something which he should not do. The opponents
of docking are not persons who have driven
high-spirited horses or who know anything about
either tandem or four-in-hand driving. The danger,
when a horse gets his tail over the rein, is multiplied
a hundred-fold when he is the leader of a tandem,
for in that case the driver is absolutely helpless;
there is nothing that he can do but either jump out
of the trap and run to the leader’s head or wait until
such time as the leader may see fit to let the rein go.
In the meantime the leader may be kicking, turning,
pulling to one side, running away, upsetting the cart,
or doing any one of a thousand things which the driver
cannot in any way prevent. In pair driving it is
also a very serious thing if either horse puts his tail
over a rein. The result is that immediately control
is lost not only over him but over the other horse
as well, for half of the control over the other is had
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_243" id="Page_243" title="243"> </a><!--259.png-->
through the coupling rein which is buckled to the
rein caught in the tail. Many most serious accidents
have been caused by long-tailed horses catching
the reins. I do not therefore consider it safe
for a woman to drive a long-tailed horse of any
spirit.</p>

<p>Of course roadsters or trotting horses never should
have their tails docked, nor should thoroughbreds or
polo ponies, and many hunters do not. But when
a woman drives any of these long-tailed horses, she
is taking risks which she had better avoid.</p>

<p>With regard to the looks of a horse, to my mind
no driving horse with any kind of a formal trap looks
smart with a long tail any more than he does with a
long mane, or forelock, or with the hair about his
fetlocks untrimmed. I am not talking about a horse
in the state of nature, but of a horse harnessed to
a properly appointed trap.</p>

<p>With regard to saddle horses, I think also that a
horse of the park, hack, or combination type looks
far better with his tail docked.</p>

<p>It might be said that a trotting horse is quite as
apt to get his tail over the rein as any other driving
horse, but this assertion loses sight of the very different
way in which a trotting horse is driven, and of
the fact that in a trotting wagon the driver sits so
near that he can reach down and lift the horse’s tail
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_244" id="Page_244" title="244"> </a><!--260.png-->
over, and that trotting horses are carefully trained
not to start under these circumstances.</p>

<p>Trotting horses are in a class by themselves, and
it is more reasonable to say that the tails of trotting
horses should be docked than that the tails of other
driving horses should be long.</p>

<p>With regard to the mane, every driving horse
should have his mane thinned out by pulling, so that
it may not look shaggy. Most ponies look best with
their manes closely hogged. If this gives a ewe-necked
effect the mane may be cut in a curve, short
at the head and withers and longer in the middle.
The forelock on all driving horses should be cut
entirely away.</p>

SHOW RING APPOINTMENTS</h3>


<p><span class="upper">The</span> harness should be of black patent-leather
with square wire buckles. Crests, monograms,
or initials should be small and inconspicuous: for a
single horse, placed on the standing martingale; for
a pair, on the breast plates.</p>

<p>Loin straps, which are part of the appointments
of a victoria or other trap driven by a servant,
should not be used for ladies’ traps driven by a
lady. Pole chains with oval links are permissible or
pole pieces, when the owner drives; chains are never
permissible on any trap driven by a servant. The
chains should fasten at the pole and no extra links
should be allowed to hang.</p>

<p>Phaetons for use in the country have been shown
of late, built on the lines of the George IV and
finished in natural wood, and with them russet harness
instead of black patent-leather is very smart,
and, if the trap is a light one, Dutch collars may be
used instead of Kay collars. All formal ladies’ traps
finished in dark colors should also be lined with the
owner’s colors, either black, dark blue, dark green,
or maroon, and the servants’ liveries should match
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_246" id="Page_246" title="246"> </a><!--262.png-->
the lining. Country traps of a light color should be
lined in light colors, and it looks smarter for the lining
to match the country livery, although gray liveries
may be worn with any light lining. Ladies’
traps may also be lined in leather instead of cloth
and in the same colors, and it is most important
that the trimming of the lining should be strictly in
keeping and very plain. The driving cushion should
always be covered with the same material as the lining.
The mat in the bottom of the trap should, of
course, match the lining.</p>

<p>The running gear of all ladies’ traps should be
finished in dark colors with inconspicuous striping,
and the striping should be in keeping with the lining;
that is, if the lining is other than black, the striping
should be of the same color. All light colors for the
striping, such as primrose, light red, and light green,
should be confined to sporting traps and runabouts;
light hues do not seem appropriate to formal ladies’
traps.</p>

<p>The owner’s rain coat and storm gloves should be
carried folded in the hood. The rubbers, comprising
the rubber apron and groom’s rain coat and cover
for his hat, should be folded and placed under the
seat of the rumble.</p>

HINTS ON DRIVING</h3>


<p><span class="upper">Regulate</span> the pace by the distance that you
have to go, and, whatever the distance, keep
going at a steady pace&mdash;from seven to nine miles an
hour is a good average&mdash;and it is a great mistake
in long driving to go sometimes very fast and then
try to balance it by going very slowly. In the old
coaching days, when long distances were covered
and the horses had to be kept in good condition,
the general principle was to keep the horses going
at about the same gait uphill and down, and this
applies quite as much with a pair or a single horse.
It is easier for a horse, and tires him less, to keep a
steady gait than to walk up and down hill and then
go very fast on the flat.</p>

<p>The most important thing about driving horses,
especially for distance driving, is to find by experience
their natural fast gait and then to keep them to
it, and never to urge your horses beyond their natural
gait, as nothing tires them so quickly. On the
other hand, it tires a high-spirited horse almost as
much to keep holding him back from his natural
gait. Horses, after they have been driven a bit,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_251" id="Page_251" title="251"> </a><!--267.png-->
know better than their drivers how to cover the
ground, and they generally had much better be left
to pick out their own gait than be forced to what
the driver thinks is the gait they should take. So,
in going up or down hill, if a horse shows a natural
inclination to trot up even a steep hill, let him trot
if he wants to; it will tire him less than holding
him back.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="illus-251">
<img src="images/illus-251.jpg" class="photograph" width="500" height="395" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="small-caps">Driving a Pair to a George IV Phaeton</span></div>
</div>

<p>It is also a great mistake, which many drivers
make, to walk horses down every hill they come to.
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_252" id="Page_252" title="252"> </a><!--268.png-->
Unless a hill is very steep, it is far easier to keep
up a steady even trot, and if you have a heavy trap
and find it straining your horse, drive him in the
soft part of the road, which will hold back the trap.
In going up or down very steep hills, it is easier for
the horses to zigzag from side to side, though of
course at a walk, as a hill as steep as that cannot
be undertaken at a trot.</p>

<p>Start your horses slowly and let them gradually
warm up to the work before them, and drive them
slowly, or even walk them, for the last mile or two,
so as to cool them before they go to the stable. As
in riding, follow the old adage, “Walk the first mile
out and the last mile in.”</p>

<p>When you are bringing your trap up to the house
or to the curb, so as to get out yourself, or to let some
one else out, you should rein in your horses gradually;
keep them going at a gradually diminishing trot,
until just before you are at the point at which you
are to stop, and then stop them quietly but firmly.
Do not attempt to dash up to the stopping place
and then throw the horses back on their haunches,
but do not bring your horses down to a walk twenty
feet sooner than you need to and then creep up to
the stopping place. Follow the same general principle
when you are coming to a corner or entering
a gate. That is, keep your horses well in hand and
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_253" id="Page_253" title="253"> </a><!--269.png-->
slow them down before you make the turn, but it
it is very bad style to bring your horses down to a
walk, or anything approaching a walk, before turning
a corner and to make the turn at the walk.
When going at a trot you should not make a turn
at the walk unless you wish to turn the trap entirely
around and go in the opposite direction, or unless
you have to make a turn of more than a right angle.</p>

<p>In going up driveways, as in approaching a country
house, be sure to keep your trap in the middle
of the road, and to keep your horses up to their gait,
always with your horses well in hand. Needless
to say, it looks very badly to cut in on the grass on
either side or to look as if you were cutting W’s.</p>

<p>It must be borne in mind when you are driving
into a country place, that many of them have their
drives so arranged that there is a turn to the stable
near the entrance gate. Be sure that your horses
are well in hand, and that you are prepared to turn
them to the other side, as they are sure to see the
stable turn and very apt to try to take it.</p>

<p>When you come to a hill, remember that your
horses in going up need to stretch their heads out
in order to exert their full strength. You should,
therefore, give them their heads as much as they
want, provided always that you keep them in hand.
In going downhill, on the other hand, the horses
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_254" id="Page_254" title="254"> </a><!--270.png-->
should always be reined in, though, as I have said,
not enough to bring them down to a walk unless the
hill is very steep; they should, however, be kept
well in hand in going down as there is then the
greatest danger of stumbling.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="illus-254">
<img src="images/illus-254.jpg" class="photograph" width="500" height="380" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="small-caps">Basket Phaeton</span><br />

Note position of groom and livery</div>
</div>

<p>If you are driving a trap with a brake, with which
some basket phaetons are equipped, as are all traps
for use in hilly countries except runabouts, do not
use the brake too freely. It is much better for the
horses to accustom themselves to hold the trap back
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_255" id="Page_255" title="255"> </a><!--271.png-->
than it is to have them pulling it downhill. If your
horses become accustomed to having the brake on
at every hill you go down, you will find great difficulty
in holding them when you drive them without
a brake. The brake should be reserved for use in
going down very steep hills and for emergencies, such
as having the horses get away from you when going
down a moderate hill; but the brake should never
be used, in single or pair horse driving, in pulling
up.</p>

<p>The rule of the road in this country is “keep to
the right,” but why this rule has ever been adopted,
instead of the English rule of keeping to the left, I
have never heard explained. A little reflection will
show one that the English rule of keeping to the left
is the naturally correct and sensible rule, and that
the whole theory of correct driving is based upon it.
Thus, the driver sits on the right side of the trap in
order to be able to avoid hitting a trap passing in
the opposite direction, as he is on the side where he
can best watch his own trap and the trap that might
strike him. So the whip is held in the right hand,
pointing toward the left in order not to engage with
the whip of a passing vehicle, and the reins are held
in the left hand that the whip may be held in the
right.</p>

<p>Similarly, I may add, in riding, a man rides on
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_256" id="Page_256" title="256"> </a><!--272.png-->
the woman’s right, in order that he may have the
point of danger, the middle of the road, when, if the
riders are going to collide with persons or vehicles
coming in the opposite direction, he will be the one
to suffer the collision. That keeping to the left
would be the common-sense way is quite clearly
shown by the fact that many automobiles are now
made with the chauffeur’s seat on the left, so that,
keeping to the right, he may see and not collide with
vehicles coming in the opposite direction. However,
this rule of keeping to the right is established in this
country, as it is in many of the Continental countries,
and probably will never be changed. All vehicles,
riders, etc., coming in the opposite direction,
therefore, must be passed on the right, and on
crowded roads, particularly in parks and on the
streets or avenues of the city, the driver should
habitually keep to the right of the middle of the
road. If you are driving slowly, wherever you may
be, you should keep to the extreme right in order
that vehicles going faster may be able to pass you
on the left. In passing any other vehicle or rider
going in the same direction you should keep him on
your right.</p>

<p>For driving in the show ring, the park, or any
crowded thoroughfare, the whip should be used to
indicate to those behind you what you are going to
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_257" id="Page_257" title="257"> </a><!--273.png-->
do. It is held up straight to show that you are
slackening speed or that you intend to stop. It is
carried to the right of the trap and twirled from
left to right to indicate that you are turning to
the right, and it is kept to the left and twirled from
right to left if you are turning to the left. You
should not only give these signals yourself, but you
should always observe the driver ahead of you to
see what signals he may give, and be sure when you
are driving in any crowded place to keep your
horses absolutely under control so that they may be
stopped in a moment if need be. This is particularly
important in driving in the city, where conformity
with traffic regulations makes sudden stops
necessary.</p>

<p>For all formal occasions, when you are driving
any kind of a phaeton with a rumble, you should
always have a servant on the rumble. For any formal
occasion, where it is correct to drive a trap with
a rumble, it is incorrect not to have the servant. It
is better form, even for country driving, if you take
a servant, to have him on the rumble, where he
should always be if there is a rumble. It is not
correct, where you have a rumble, to have the servant
at your side. If the horses are pulling too hard,
it is quite permissible to pass the reins back to the
servant, or he may even drive them from the rumble,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_258" id="Page_258" title="258"> </a><!--274.png-->
where he can control them quite as well as he
could if he were sitting beside you.</p>

<p>For this reason the reins are made longer for a
woman than for a man.</p>

DRESS</h3>


<p><span class="upper">While</span>, except for four-in-hand, there is no prescribed
formal costume required for driving,
at the same time there are certain general principles
which women should always observe, not only for
formal occasions, such as the show ring or park, but
whenever they take the ribbons.</p>

<p>For formal ladies’ traps, such as phaetons, it is
perfectly permissible to wear a large hat of the prevailing
fashion and an afternoon or calling gown.
Where the owner is driving a trap of this kind on
a formal occasion, the costume should not be tailor-made,
and her costume should produce the effect
that she is out for a pleasure drive. With sporting
traps and carts of all kinds, on the other hand, the
costume should be strictly tailor-made and the hat
small and not inclined to blow off. This is particularly
so for tandem driving, and in that case the
general effect should be mannish, and particular
care should be taken to have everything securely
fastened so that undivided attention may be given
to the horses and reins. For driving tandem, or for
any kind of a sporting vehicle or cart in the country,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_260" id="Page_260" title="260"> </a><!--276.png-->
a plain sailor is the most appropriate as well as one
of the easiest to keep on, and veils, as well as other
feminine adornments, look quite out of place. The
hair, of course, should be neatly and securely done,
and boots or low shoes are much more appropriate
than high-heeled slippers with open-work stockings.</p>

<p>It is always correct, under any circumstances, to
carry a lap robe, and while in the show ring it may
remain on the seat on the left side of the driver.
For other occasions it is better to spread it over the
knees to keep off the dust. If it is spread, be sure
that it is neatly tucked in about the feet, but to do
this requires some knack, and the best way to arrange
the robe is to have it come over the feet so that the
heels will rest upon it, and then to have the right
end placed under you so as to entirely cover the
lower part of your knee. If you are driving alone
both sides should be adjusted in the same way, but,
of course, if you have a companion the robe should
cover you both.</p>

<p>For tandem a driving apron is permissible, but
is not required, instead of a robe, and for four-in-hand
driving it is required.</p>

<p>The costume for four-in-hand driving, as worn
by the members of the New York Ladies’ Coaching
Club, is a rough gray beaver top hat with a double-breasted
dark-blue melton driving coat. Under the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_261" id="Page_261" title="261"> </a><!--277.png-->
coat is worn a plain tailor-made cloth suit of any
smart material, such as a check or a stripe. Some
members wear spats, which are very smart. Heavy
tan driving gloves are worn, and the driving apron
is laid across the knees and strapped around the
waist over the driving coat.</p>

<p>For the show ring heavy white driving gloves
or tan driving gloves are equally correct, as they are
for other occasions. When driving ladies’ traps, if
you are wearing a gown with short sleeves and
therefore are wearing long gloves, they should be
slipped off the hands and folded back so that only
the arms are covered and then driving gloves should
be slipped on the hands. When driving a George IV,
where a card-case is part of the appointments, it is
a good idea to fold a fresh pair of gloves in the card-case.</p>

<p>For all formal occasions, such as the show ring
and park and town driving, the servant should wear
a groom’s dress livery, consisting of a single-breasted
long coat with six buttons in front and two rows of
three buttons in the back. The coat should come
to five inches above the knee and should always
be kept buttoned. It should be of the color which
the family may have adopted&mdash;black, dark blue,
dark green, maroon, or gray, etc. The coat collar
should be of the same material as the coat and the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_262" id="Page_262" title="262"> </a><!--278.png-->
cuffs should be plain without buttons. Under the
coat a waistcoat should always be worn, of some
striped material, a small strip showing inside the
collar. A plain white Ascot tie and standing collar
should be worn, but no cuffs, and the coat sleeves
should be very long, coming well down to the
hand. The breeches must be white&mdash;of buckskin
or breeches cloth. Stiff-legged top boots should be
worn, with tops of tan or buff, or of some color
which matches or goes well with the color of the
coat. The boots must always be of calf and never
of patent or varnished leather. A silk top hat
should be worn, with a narrow silk band. In this
country it is improper to use cockades except for
officers of the army and navy and other officials.
The gloves should be tan, but white buckskin gloves
are correct for park or town driving.</p>

</div>
<div class="caption"><span class="small-caps">Correct Groom’s Livery</span></div>
</div>

<p>For country wear, particularly in summer, this
full-dress livery is too hot and looks out of place, so
that an undress livery should be worn. The best
style of undress livery is a morning or cutaway coat
with three buttons in front and two in the back, cut
like any morning coat, but a little higher in the neck,
and breeches and leggings of the same material, or
perhaps leather puttee leggings. This livery is made
of covert cloth or whip-cord, and the color may
be any shade of gray or any shade of tan. If the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_263" id="Page_263" title="263"> </a><!--279.png-->
livery is gray, it is smarter to wear black leggings
rather than tan, and when the leggings are
black, black shoes should always be worn, and russet
shoes with tan leggings. The hat to wear with
this livery should be the same shape as a top hat,
of black felt for a gray livery, or of brown felt to
match the tan livery, or a straw hat of the same shape
may be worn, black to go with the dark livery or
straw color with any livery. Tan gloves are correct
with undress livery. A sack coat is sometimes used
instead of a cutaway, but I think the latter very
much smarter, and if a sack coat is worn a top hat
should not be worn, but rather a square derby.</p>

BITS AND BEARING REINS</h3>


<p><span class="upper">In</span> the illustration on the opposite page are shown
the various types of driving bits, and I shall not
attempt to describe them in detail any more than I
did with respect to the riding bits. They are fully
treated in many of the standard works on the subject
and a detailed description of them would not
belong in this book.</p>

<p>For single horse driving either the Liverpool or
Ashleigh is correct for all occasions, except for the
show ring and park driving with ladies’ traps, such as
the George IV or Peters’ phaeton, where the Buxton
is the correct bit for single horses as well as pairs,
and except also for gigs where a gig bit is correct.
Gig bits, however, should not be used with other
traps than gigs. For pair horse driving the Buxton
is correct for the show ring and park driving and
may be used for informal occasions, though personally
I think it rather poor form for country driving
with any kind of trap. The Buxton, however, not
having a hole to correspond with the “half cheek”
of the Liverpool or Ashleigh, is, unless you use the
“full cheek,” rather a severe bit for any but a skilled
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_265" id="Page_265" title="265"> </a><!--281.png-->
driver with light hands. For pair driving a pivoted
bit should always be used. The Liverpool is not so
suitable for pair driving as the Ashleigh or other
elbow bits, because even when the bars are pivoted
they do not turn freely, so that the two inside bars
are usually pulling at an angle on the bit, and do
not give an even pull on the horses’ mouths.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="small-caps">Bits</span></div>
</div>

<p>If your horse has a very light mouth, and you
have not acquired very light hands, it may be better
to drive with the reins in the full cheek. If,
however, you have acquired light hands, the reins
had better be in the half cheek of the Liverpool or
Ashleigh, or in the middle bar of the Buxton, as this
gives much more control and “feel” of the horse’s
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_266" id="Page_266" title="266"> </a><!--282.png-->
mouth. In fact, no competent whip with light hands,
particularly no woman, will want to drive a horse,
however light his mouth, in the full cheek. If your
horse’s mouth is rather hard and there is danger of
his running away, it is better to have the reins in
the first hole of the bar of the Liverpool or Ashleigh,
but if you drive him this way you must keep
a very light hand, as it makes the pressure of the
curb chain too severe, and you may make his mouth
hard by a constant pressure of chain. If you are
unfortunate enough to have to drive a puller, it will
probably be necessary to put the reins in the second
hole of the bar, and even to twist the curb chain,
and to use a special form of bit with a long port or
other device intended to stop a pulling horse. No
woman, however, should have a pulling horse in her
stable.</p>

<p>In pair driving the bitting is most important.
It is the rarest thing in the world to find two horses
who are not only well matched in appearance but
have the same dispositions and require the same bitting.
In fact, there is an old saying, “There is always
one to a pair.” By correct bitting and a proper
adjustment of the coupling reins the differences in
the dispositions of the two horses can be equalized,
and they can be made to go well together. This is
a point which is very frequently neglected by inexperienced
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_267" id="Page_267" title="267"> </a><!--283.png-->
drivers, and few coachmen really understand
it, so that you must learn it yourself and see
that your coachman has your horses properly bitted
and coupled.</p>

<p>The general principle, of course, is that the slow
horse of the pair should have the reins in the cheek
or half cheek, while the fast horse should have them
in the half cheek, or the first, or even the second,
hole in the bar, and it may be found necessary to
put a severe bit on the fast horse and a plain bit
on the slow one. Similarly, if one horse has a light
mouth and the other a hard one, the bits and the
coupling reins must be regulated and the curb
chains adjusted accordingly. It is impossible to lay
down any fixed rules to follow. It is all a matter of
experiment with the particular pair of horses that
you are driving.</p>

<p>Of equal importance with the proper adjustment
of the bits and of the reins in the cheek or bar is
the adjustment of the coupling reins. These are the
two shorter inside reins by which the near horse is
coupled with the off rein and the off horse with the
near rein. The coupling reins should be so adjusted
that the pressure on the reins of each horse will be
the same; that is, the off horse should have the same
pressure from the off rein as he has from the near
coupling rein, and the near horse should have the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_268" id="Page_268" title="268"> </a><!--284.png-->
same pressure from the near rein as from the off
coupling rein.</p>

<p>If it happens that the two horses go absolutely
together and have the same mouths and the same
dispositions, which, as I have said, is almost never
the case, then the coupling reins will be buckled in
the same hole on each rein. If the two horses have
different mouths or different dispositions, the buckles
will have to be shifted accordingly. That is, for instance,
if the near horse has more life or a harder
mouth, the off coupling rein must be taken up so
that there will be more pressure on him than on the
off horse. The coupling reins are also adjusted for
the purpose of bringing the two horses nearer together,
and for keeping their heads together or apart
as may be necessary.</p>

<p>The two horses of a pair should have their bodies
and heads straight and parallel to the pole, but it
will be found that some horses are inclined to carry
their heads to one side or the other, and the coupling
reins should be taken up or loosened accordingly.
For example, if the near horse carries his head to the
near side, the off coupling rein must be taken up,
which compels him to straighten his head.</p>

<p>If you have two horses that seem to be perfectly
matched, but the off horse carries his head a little out
to the front and has a light mouth, and the near
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_269" id="Page_269" title="269"> </a><!--285.png-->
horse carries his head close to his chest and has a
hard mouth, to get them to pull together and keep
them well in the traces the coupling rein of the off
horse should be two or three holes shorter than that
of the near, and consequently the off coupling rein will
be let out and the near coupling rein taken in, and
in such case the off horse, if he has a light mouth,
should be driven in the cheek and the hard-mouthed
near horse down in the bar.</p>

<p>A common fault of coachmen and grooms lies
in buckling both coupling reins too tightly, which
makes the horses carry their heads in toward the
pole instead of going away straight. This looks very
badly, makes the horses’ mouths hard, and either
keeps the horses going diagonally or causes them to
carry their heads crooked.</p>

<p>If horses have acquired, through wrong coupling,
the habit of turning their heads in toward the pole,
or their quarters out from it, it is sometimes a good
plan to change their positions instead of always driving
them on the same side. Then, on the other hand,
horses sometimes get into the habit of leaning in
against the pole. This is a difficult habit to break,
but by changing their positions or by adjusting the
bits and the coupling reins, and steady and careful
driving, this habit can be broken.</p>

<p>Bearing reins are required in the appointments
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_270" id="Page_270" title="270"> </a><!--286.png-->
for ladies’ traps except for runabouts and pony carts,
and I believe generally in their use with nearly every
kind of trap, and with single horses as well as with
pairs. It is only the abuse of bearing reins, and not
the use, which has led to the outcry so generally
made against them by persons ignorant of the principles
and practice of driving.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="illus-270">
<img src="images/illus-270.jpg" class="photograph" width="500" height="399" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="small-caps">Proper Adjustment of Bearing Reins</span></div>
</div>

<p>Bearing reins should be just tight enough to keep
the horse’s head up in its natural position. When
so adjusted they prevent a horse from putting his
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_271" id="Page_271" title="271"> </a><!--287.png-->
head down and getting the bit in his teeth; they
prevent him from putting his tongue over the bit
and do a great deal toward preventing him from
kicking.</p>

<p>Bearing reins are particularly necessary in pair
driving, for however well matched two horses may
be in general appearance, they seldom carry their
heads naturally at just the same height. In that
case the horse who naturally carries his head high
should have his bearing rein quite loose and the
other quite tight, so that their heads may be at
the same height. Nothing looks worse than to see
two horses in a pair carrying their heads one low
and one high. Most of the best authorities on driving
also say, and I have no doubt that it is true,
that bearing reins keep a tired horse up and make
his going easy; they also keep him from nodding.</p>

<p>Of course, many thoughtless grooms draw the
bearing reins altogether too tight, so as to force the
horse’s head up and make him almost ewe-necked.
This naturally frets a horse, especially when he is
standing still. The bearing reins should be fastened
to a bridoon and not to the bit, as, if fastened to the
bit, they raise it too high and are apt to spoil the
“feel” of the horse’s mouth.</p>

<p>For runabouts, at all times, bearing reins should
be dispensed with, and they may be dispensed with
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_272" id="Page_272" title="272"> </a><!--288.png-->
for informal country driving in any kind of carriage,
especially with a single horse. When bearing reins
are used they should generally be loosened if the
horses are to stand for any length of time.</p>

<p>The overhead check-rein should never be used,
except with roadsters or trotting horses.</p>

HARNESS</h3>


<p><span class="upper">The</span> use of silver-plated instead of brass-plated
harness for formal occasions, such as the show
ring and park, is optional, but brass-plated harness
is more suitable than silver-plated for informal occasions
and for country driving.</p>

<p>The correct appointments for a woman’s trap in
the show ring are given in a separate chapter, <a href="#Page_245">page
245</a>. For other occasions the buckles, etc., may be
either square or round, according to the owner’s fancy.
Square buckles are more appropriate for formal
occasions and perhaps for four-wheel traps; round
buckles are rather for carts and sporting vehicles.
There should be as little metal about the harness as
practicable, and the ornaments should be confined
to crests, engravings, or initials, which should be small
and inconspicuous and placed only on the winkers,
rosettes, face pieces, standing martingale, and pad.
Breechings may be used for heavy traps, but are
not suitable for light traps such as runabouts or
for carts. They sometimes make a nervous horse
kick, and in such cases they should, of course, be
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_274" id="Page_274" title="274"> </a><!--290.png-->
dispensed with. Kicking straps, as I have said
elsewhere, should generally be used for a kicking
horse both with four-wheel traps and with carts.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="illus-274">
<img src="images/illus-274.jpg" width="493" height="500" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="small-caps">Single Phaeton Harness</span><br />

May be used with runabout, when breeching need not be used, and Dutch
collar may be used instead of Kay collar</div>
</div>

<p>The harness should be made of the best quality
of leather and hand sewn, and should always be
kept soft and pliable, and never allowed to become
hard or mildewed.</p>

<p>Russet harness is perfectly correct for informal
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_275" id="Page_275" title="275"> </a><!--291.png-->
country driving and with runabouts or any kind
of light country trap, whether two or four wheeled,
particularly with traps finished in natural wood.</p>

<p>For all heavy traps, whether four or two wheeled,
collars and harness should be used, and it is essential
that the collar should fit the horse. In fact, it
is most important that each horse in the stable
should have his own collar, which should be carefully
fitted to him by a competent harness-maker.
Collars come in standard sizes, varying from 19
to 22 inches, and are made to fit by altering the
stuffing. The Kay collar is the type generally used.</p>

<p>The weight of the harness is in proportion to the
weight of the trap; for heavy traps, such as phaetons
or dog-carts, the heaviest harness should be
used, while with runabouts, basket phaetons, and
light carts, lighter harness is correct.</p>

<p>For country use, and especially in summer with
all kinds of light country traps, such as runabouts,
Hempstead carts, and breaking carts, a Dutch collar
is quite correct and is much more comfortable and
cooler for the horse than a collar and hames. The
Dutch collar, however, should not be used with any
kind of a heavy or formal trap, as it is not so well
adapted for pulling, nor does it look well with
them.</p>

<p>The lining of the collar should be black for all
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_276" id="Page_276" title="276"> </a><!--292.png-->
except sporting carts, where russet lining looks very
smart, though almost too sporty for a woman.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="illus-276">
<img src="images/illus-276.jpg" width="500" height="405" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="small-caps">Single Road Harness</span><br />

Note the light Dutch collar</div>
</div>

<p>Driving reins for a woman should be thinner and
lighter than for a man, and should be very pliable
for the same reasons, as I have explained on <a href="#Page_145">page 145</a>,
that apply to riding reins.</p>

<p>The general principle to be observed in driving,
as well as in riding, is to have as little harness on
the horse as practicable, and, above all things, not
to have the harness overloaded with ornaments.</p>

<p>For country use, and for all informal occasions,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_277" id="Page_277" title="277"> </a><!--293.png-->
it is not necessary to use patent-leather harness,
as it scratches and becomes shabby very quickly.
Plain black pigskin is therefore more appropriate
and perfectly correct for such occasions. For rainy
weather special harness should be used, as the rain
injures the leather and tarnishes the metal of the
regular harness, and entails a great deal of unnecessary
work on the grooms. Rainy weather harness
has all the buckles covered and is made of oiled
leather.</p>

<p>When the owner is in deep mourning, everything
about the harness should be black, all of the bright
metal should be covered with black leather. It
looks quite inappropriate to see the servants with
wide crape bands but the harness with all the
bright metal showing and colored rosettes and saddle
cloths; or, what is even worse, colored saddle
cloths and black rosettes. While it is not necessary
to use black harness when the owner is in
mourning, all colors should certainly be avoided in
the rosettes and saddle cloths, and the servants
should be put in mourning also.</p>

<p>What I have just said in the chapter on harness
for single horses applies generally to harness for a
pair.</p>

<p>Kay collars should be used for pairs with all traps,
except that Dutch collars may be used for a pair with
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_278" id="Page_278" title="278"> </a><!--294.png-->
runabouts or any other light country trap. There
is a very light station trap, finished in natural wood,
with which russet harness with Dutch collars, for a
pair, looks very smart and may be used in the
country.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="illus-278">
<img src="images/illus-278.jpg" width="500" height="395" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="small-caps">Double Road Harness</span><br />

Note the yoke</div>
</div>

<p>The horses may be coupled to the pole with
either pole chains or pole pieces; the former with
oval links are correct when the owner drives, but
are never permissible in any trap driven by a servant.
The chains should fasten at the pole and no
extra links should be allowed to hang. The pole
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_279" id="Page_279" title="279"> </a><!--295.png-->
chains, if used, should be of burnished steel and not
of brass. Oddly enough, for some reason which has
never been explained, pole chains and pole pieces
are regarded as belonging to the trap and not to the
harness.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="illus-279">
<img src="images/illus-279.jpg" width="500" height="411" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="small-caps">English Phaeton Pair Harness</span><br />

Note the loin straps, which are correct only when servant is driving</div>
</div>

<p>Loin straps should be used with a lady’s trap
only when a servant drives.</p>

<p>The winkers should be square when square buckles
are used, but round winkers may be used, as well
as round buckles with sporting traps, for which they
are quite appropriate.</p>
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_280" id="Page_280" title="280"> </a><!--296.png-->

<p>Metal rosettes should be used with a single harness
and may be used with pair harness, or for
ladies’ traps. Silk rosettes may be used of any color
the owner may fancy, and should match the liveries.
In the show ring and park flower rosettes are worn,
but with pairs fancy rosettes are worn on the near
side of the near horse and the off side of the off
horse; that is, one on each horse on the outside, while
on the inside the rosettes should be plain metal.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="illus-280">
<img src="images/illus-280.jpg" class="photograph" width="500" height="332" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="small-caps">A Hempstead Cart</span></div>
</div>

<p>Double harness should fit the horses just as single
harness does, except that the belly-bands should be
looser, so as to admit two or three fingers between
them and the girths.</p>
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_281" id="Page_281" title="281"> </a><!--297.png-->

<p>A whip with a lash should always be used, except
with roadsters or trotting horses, when a straight whip
is correct. The whip should be of a length proportionate
to the trap and the distance of the horse
from the driver. The same kind of whip should be
used for driving a single horse as for a pair. The
shaft should be straight and may be of any color
the owner fancies, and may be mounted in gold,
silver, or brass. The best whips in general use are
made of holly. For a woman’s use a whip should
be lighter and more slender than for a man’s. A
heavy whip is very tiring to the hand, and quite unnecessary
for the kind of horse that a woman drives.
The handle of the whip may be covered with leather
or plain, and, if leather covered, may be of any color
which goes well with the shaft. While colored snappers
are used, plain white is always correct, and I
consider it much smarter.</p>

<p>The lash of the whip should always be kept
white and very pliable, and, of course, should be
pipe-clayed when necessary.</p>

<p>For a phaeton or breaking cart, where the horse
is quite a long distance from the driver, a much
longer whip should be used than for a runabout or
a Hempstead cart.</p>

<div class="title">NOTES</div>

<p><i>Classes 3 and 5</i>: Hunters to be shown over jumps,
which may be merely post and rail, brush, in and
out, or any combination of these, performance over
jumps only to count.</p>

<p><i>Event No. 8</i>: Starters will be handed a large
wooden spoon and an egg. The spoon must be
carried in one hand, with the egg in the bowl, twice
around the course. Any one dropping the egg must
return to the starting point for another, and whoever
first completes the two rounds of the course
with an unbroken egg held throughout in the spoon
wins the race.</p>

<p><i>Event No. 9</i>: There must be a fence or wall down
the middle of the course. The stalls are made with
poles, which are attached at one end to the fence
and at the other end to stakes driven in the ground.
At the start there should be one less stall than there
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_284" id="Page_284" title="284"> </a><!--300.png-->
are contestants, and the length of the fence should
be such that at the start there will be no fence lapping
over. The stalls should be between three and four
feet wide and all stalls on the same side of the fence.</p>

<p>The contestants start mounted; when the music
plays they ride in single file around the fence in a
ring until the music stops; the riders then dash for
the stalls and the rider who is left over is out of the
contest. Before the music starts again one stall is
removed, and the performance is repeated until there
are only two contestants left for one stall, and then
whoever of these gets it wins the event. The horses
may be ridden into the stalls backward, forward, or
any way in which they can get in. In other words,
it is the old game of “Going to Jerusalem.”</p>

<p><i>Event No. 10</i>: The contestants are in pairs, a
man and a woman, each with his pony. All the
contestants start dismounted. At the starting signal
the man first puts the woman up, then mounts
himself; they join hands and dash madly down the
field and race twice around the course, holding hands.
The pair to reach the finish first win the race. If
desired, jumps may be introduced.</p>

<p><i>Event No. 11</i>: The contestants may be all men,
all women, or both. The contestants start mounted
at one end of the course, each of them having a
spear; at the other end of the course are six or eight
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_285" id="Page_285" title="285"> </a><!--301.png-->
potatoes for each contestant, those of each contestant
being placed together in a row and opposite his
place in line at the start. The contestants must pick
up the potatoes, one at a time, with the spear, ride
back to the starting point, and drop each potato in
a basket. The one who first picks up all his potatoes,
carries them on his spear, and drops them all in
the basket, wins the race. If a contestant drops a
potato on the way back to the starting point he
must pick up that potato with his spear without
dismounting.</p>

</div>
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_286" id="Page_286" title="286"> </a><!--302.png-->

<p><i>Event No. 12</i>: This event, if my memory serves
me right, was originated by Mr. F.&nbsp;M. Lowry, M.F.H.,
of the Harkaway Hunt, McDonald, Pennsylvania,
and it can take place only in a hunting country or
where one or more packs of hounds are available;
it can, of course, only be tried where the grounds
are large. A drag is laid over the country, taking
as many fences as may be desired, but without flags
or other indications of the course. The finish should
be at the grand stand. Each hound wears a ribbon
of a distinctive color and each rider draws by lot a
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_287" id="Page_287" title="287"> </a><!--303.png-->
card with the corresponding color of that worn by
a hound. The riders all follow the hounds, and the
holder of the color of the hound which first arrives
at the finish is awarded the cup, provided that the
hound has followed the full course. There need be
no contest between the riders as to who shall be first
at the finish.</p>

</div>

<p>Of course the above programme is for an open-air
or summer show, but all the classes and many of
the events may be used in-doors in a ring. To take
the place of the events which must necessarily be
omitted for an in-door show, I would suggest a
costume ride. The style of costume may be left to
the choice of the riders, or some particular period or
type may be adopted. The riders go through the
evolutions of a drill to music.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="small-caps">Gymkhana Games at Country Show</span></div>
</div>

<p>Another suitable event for an in-door show is
tandem riding which has become deservedly popular.
The horse one rides is saddled and the reins and all
appointments are the same as for ordinary riding,
with the exception that the bridle has the usual D’s
similar to those of the wheeler of the tandem, through
which the reins of the leader pass. The leader has
a harness which consists of a pad with terrets and
a driving bridle without winkers and whatever form
of bit may best suit the individual horse. The reins
are of white buckskin, the size of light driving
<a name="Page_288" id="Page_288" > </a><!--304.png [full-page illo]-->
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_289" id="Page_289" title="289"> </a><!--305.png-->
tandem lead reins. There should be about a half a
horse’s length between the two horses. The best
and most practical way of holding the reins I have
found to be as follows: Treat the curb and snaffle
reins of the horse you are riding as if they were one
rein and separate them both by the middle and third
fingers; that is to say, the near curb is laid on top
of the near snaffle rein and they both pass between
the middle and third fingers. The off snaffle is laid
on top of the off curb rein and they pass between the
first and middle fingers. The ends come up between
the thumb and forefinger. The near lead rein passes
under the middle finger and up through the hand,
coming out between the third and fourth fingers.
The off lead rein passes down between the third and
fourth fingers and passes out under the middle finger.
An ordinary light driving whip is held in the usual
way for driving in the right hand, and the right hand
is held in readiness to assist the left and particularly
to turn the leader. Horses, with a little training,
are easily ridden or driven in this way and can be
taught to jump and go through complicated evolutions.
This tandem riding is a suitable event for
winter entertainments in clubs and riding-schools.</p>
